# Ozone (Menu Interface)

**Ozone** is the default graphical user interface (gui) of RetroArch. Based on the Switch's menu design, this menu driver was introduced in RetroArch 1.7.6.

|Keyboard key assignments may differ by platform and configuration: Most of the examples below are for PC.|

## Menu Structure

Ozone's main categories and playlists are in a column on the left, and subcategories are in a panel to the right. A third column will appear on the right hand side when certain selections are made.

Entering a subcategory will hide the top-level menu's text labels. When you return to Main Categories, the descriptions will reappear. The sidebar does not collapse while in Main Menu or Settings.

If you want the labels to always be hidden, go to `Settings> User Interface> Appearance`, then turn `Collapse the Sidebar` on.

### Navigating the menu

Ozone is controlled like any other user interface. Regular input binds will apply, and binds here are defined in terms of the RetroPad, RetroArch's gamepad and joystick abstraction.

| Controller   | Default PC | Action |
| ------------ | ---------- | ------ |
| **A button** | Z/ENTER/Left mouse click | Accept/OK |
| **B button** | X/Backspace/Right mouse click | Back/Cancel |
| **D-pad Up/Down/Left/Right** | Arrow keys | Scroll through menu options |
| N/A          | **Right shift** | Toggle description label |
| N/A          | **S key** | Toggle search |
| N/A          | **F1** | Toggle quick menu |
| N/A          | **F5** | Toggle desktop menu |

See [Input and Controls](input-and-controls.md).

### Searching through lists with the keyboard

When using a keyboard, it can be slow to navigate a large list using gamepad-like controls. To help this, you can type `/` (forward slash) or `S` (S key) at any time to bring up a search box.

Type a search string and hit `Return`. The cursor should jump to the first entry that matches.

The search will match mid-path strings. However, if a match is found at the beginning of the path (like when searching for the first letter), the start-of-path match will take priority.

### Starting a game

* To load a game you need two things: A libretro core to act as a gaming system, and content (a ROM or ISO) to play on that system.
* Select `Load Core` from the main menu to browse a list of installed cores. You need to select the core compatible with your content from the `core` list.
* If you have no cores listed, or you want additional cores, click on `Download a Core` at the bottom of the list and make your selection(s).

After loading a libretro core, you will see the name and version of the core in the bottom left of the window. You can then browse for a ROM via `Main Menu> Load Content`.
To control where Ozone starts to browse for contents, set `File Browser` in `Settings > Directory`. If this is not set, the file browser will start in the user's root directory.

See [File Browser](file-browser.md) and [Import Content](import-content.md)

## Thumbnails

Thumbnails appear in a side bar on the right side of the screen. With a playlist item selected, you can press the `spacebar` on your keyboard to toggle the full-screen view on/off.

The default thumbnail is Boxart. Two thumbnails can be displayed simultaneously by going to `Settings> User Interface> Appearance` and enabling `Secondary Thumbnail`. The user can choose to display boxart, the title screen, or a gameplay screenshot.

## Audio

Ozone has **OK**, **Cancel**, **Notice** and **Scroll** sound effects. It also has background music, created by [ViRiX Dreamcore](https://soundcloud.com/virix).

<audio controls>

</audio>

These are turned off by default. To enable them, go to `Settings> Audio> Menu Sounds` and turn on the `Mixer`. Then in the same menu, turn on the sounds you want (the background music option is called `Enable BGM Sound`).
