# Libretro Docs

This repository contains the source for the official Libretro and RetroArch documentation, available at [docs.libretro.com](https://docs.libretro.com/).

# Contribute to the documentation

These docs are written in [Markdown.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown) If you need help with the syntax, use [this guide](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/). Mkdocs uses some [Markdown extensions](http://www.mkdocs.org/user-guide/writing-your-docs/#markdown-extensions) that you may have to familiarize with.

The documentation source is maintained via [Git](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Git). For more info on how to use git, [refer to Github's help page.](https://help.github.com/)

In order to propose improvements to a document:

There is a To-Do list for libretro/docs *here* and you can submit suggestions or issues regarding documentation at the [libretro/docs issue tracker](https://github.com/libretro/docs/issues).

## Building the docs

1. Make sure you have [Python](https://www.python.org/) and [pip](https://pip.pypa.io) installed
    ```
    python --version
    pip --version
    ```

!!! Note "Building in Windows/msys2"
    If you are using the standard RetroArch msys2 environment, you will need to install python with the command `pacman -S python`. Next you will need to download [the `get-pip.py` script](https://bootstrap.pypa.io/get-pip.py) from the `pip` bootstrap site. Finally, execute the script with the command `python get-pip.py`.

2. Install MkDocs
    ```
    pip install mkdocs
    ```

3. Install MkDocs-Material
    ```
    pip install mkdocs-material
    ```

4. Install PyMdown Extensions
    ```
    pip install pymdown-extensions
    ```
5. Install mkdocs-git-revision-date
    ```
    pip install mkdocs-git-revision-date-plugin
    ```
6. Install mkdocs-macros
    ```
    pip install mkdocs-macros-plugin
    ```

7. Build the site
    ```
    mkdocs build
    ```

8. The documentation will be built to the `site` directory; preview any changes with MkDocs' built-in dev-server before submitting a pull request
    ```
    mkdocs serve
    ```
