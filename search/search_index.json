For example, the libretro pointer abstraction is available for emulating input for systems like the Nintendo DS; frontends can allow the user to map a mouse or other suitable input device in addition to a hardware touchscreen.

For this reason, the engine should not rely on system timers to perform arbitrary synchronization. This is common and often needed in 3D games to account for varying frame rates while still maintaining a playable game.</p> <p>However, libretro targets classic systems where one can assume that 100% real-time performance will always be met, thus avoiding the need for careful timing code. By default, the libretro implementation should replace any arbitrary <code>sleep()</code> and <code>time()</code> patterns with simply calling video/audio callbacks. The frontend will make sure to apply the proper synchronization. This is mostly a problem with game ports, such as PrBoom. For the libretro port of PrBoom, which heavily relied on timers and sleeping patterns, sleeping was replaced with simply running for one frame, and calling the video callback. After that, enough audio was rendered to correspond to one frames worth of time, 1/fps seconds.

How to do that with GENie is not clear.</p> <p>To solve all of these issues at once, we leave libretro.c out of the OSD library and add it to the main MAME library directly.

It could probably be split into its own file, but hasn't been thus far for simplicity.</p> <p>The only other addition is <code>scripts/src/osd/retro.lua</code> and its <code>cfg</code> file which isn't strictly necessary to be a separate file.  Pretty standard stuff in there.  The real work is in main.lua, and it's all contingent upon use of the libretro OSD to be as minimally invasive into MAME as possible.</p> <p>That's about it really.

Netplay supports up to 16 players and many spectators. Netplay in RetroArch is guaranteed\u00b9 to work with perfect synchronization given a few minor constraints:</p> <ol> <li>The core is deterministic,</li> <li>The only input devices the core interacts with are the gamepad and analog sticks, and</li> <li>Both the core and the loaded content are identical on host and client.</li> </ol> <p>Cores are expected to support serialization for proper netplay behavior, but netplay will work in limited fashion with cores that do not support serialization. The experience will be far more smooth with serialization.</p> <p>Netplay in RetroArch works by expecting input to come delayed from the network, then rewinding and re-playing with the delayed input to get a consistent state. At any given time, all netplay clients may be in inconsistent states, but once they receive each other's delayed data, they invisibly rewind to the last time they were consistent, replay with the new input, and reach a new state, notionally closer to the \"correct\", canonical state than the previous one.  So long as both sides agree on which frame is which, it should be impossible for them to become de-synced, since each input event always happens at the correct frame.</p> <p>\u00b9 Guarantee not actually a guarantee.</p>"},{"location":"development/retroarch/netplay/#behavior","title":"Behavior","text":"<p>Netplay's protocol uses TCP, as reliability and in-order delivery are both mandatory for correct behavior.</p> <p>A single netplay server may have connections from multiple netplay clients. For most behavior, the server and client are equal participants, but for operations which require global synchronization, the server is canonical. In normal, running behavior, each playing client simply sends the input state of their controller every frame, and the server forwards input data between clients. Every client and the server is aware of which player slots are in use (i.e., which controllers are plugged in), and the server is aware of which client corresponds to which player slot.</p> <p>It is crucial that every player send their input data in order for every frame, and thus every client keeps in mind the frame counter for every player. If input data is received with an unexpectedly low frame number, it is ignored, and if input data is received with an unexpectedly high frame number, the connection is terminated. It is also crucial that every player agree on which frame is which, and so during initial connection the server gives a canonical frame count and a serialized save state, allowing the client to join mid-stream.</p> <p>Spectators send no input data.</p> <p>When new input data is received from a player, if it is before the currently executing frame, RetroArch will invisibly rewind and replay with the new input data, arriving at the original frame so that the local player's own input is always seemless.</p> <p>A typical, playing client sends no data other than its own input every frame. During normal play, the server sends its own input data. If the server is not playing, but spectating, it sends a special \"no input\" packet, so that clients may nonetheless no its frame count. Other spectators send no data.</p> <p>Other events coordinate on the server's frame counter, and most may therefore only be performed by the server. For instance, for a client to switch from spectating to playing, it cannot simply start sending input data, but must send a request to change modes, which the server will honor at its present frame count. The client may have to rewind to send data from earlier frames, or wait to send input data until its local frame count has reached the server's.</p> <p>In particular, resets and savestate loads are always synchronized to the server's frame count, and thus only the server may reset the core or load a savestate. Because input preceeding a savestate load is irrelevant, upon receiving a savestate load command, all frame counts are updated to be at least the server's frame count, including the local frame count if applicable. This is the only condition under which the frame count will skip at a rate greater than one frame per executed frame.</p>"},{"location":"development/retroarch/netplay/#implementation","title":"Implementation","text":"<p>Netplay is in effect a buffer of input states (implemented as a ring of buffers) and some pre- and post-frame behaviors.</p> <p>There are three important locations, each of which : self, other and unread. Each refers to a frame, and a state buffer corresponding to that frame. The state buffer contains the savestate for the frame, and the input from both the local and remote players.</p> <p>Self is where RetroArch believes itself to be, which may be ahead or behind of what it's read from the peer. Self progresses at a rate of one frame per executed frame, except when the local frame count is forced to skip ahead due to loading a state.</p> <p>Unread is the first frame at which not all players' data has been read. Typically unread is less than self, but it is possible for one client to get ahead of others.</p> <p>Other is where it was most recently in perfect sync: i.e., other-1 is the last frame from which all local and remote input have been actioned. It is never necessary to rewind farther than other in order to attain synchronization, and other is always less than or equal to both self and unread. Since the state buffer is a ring, other is the first frame that it's unsafe to overwrite.</p> <p>The server has a slightly more complicated job as it can handle multiple clients, however it is not vastly more complicated: For each connection which is playing (i.e., has a controller), it maintains a per-player unread frame, and the global unread frame is the earliest of each player unread frame. The server forwards input data: When input data is received from an earlier frame than the server's current frame, it forwards it immediately. Otherwise, it forwards it when the frame is reached. i.e., during frame n, the server may send its own and any number of other players' data for frame n, but will never send frame n+1. This is because the server's clock is the arbiter of all synchronization-related events, such as flipping players, players joining and parting, and saving/loading states.</p> <p>Pre-frame, netplay serializes the core's state, polls for local input, and polls for input from the network. If the input from the network is too far behind (i.e., unread is too far behind self), it stalls to allow the other side to catch up. To assure that this stalling does not block the UI thread, it is implemented similarly to pausing, rather than by blocking on the socket.</p> <p>If input has not been received for the other side up to the current frame (the usual case), the remote input is simulated in a simplistic manner.  Each frame's local serialized state and simulated or real input goes into the frame buffers.</p> <p>During the frame of execution, when the core requests input, it receives the input from the state buffer, both local and real or simulated remote.</p> <p>Post-frame, it checks whether it's read more than it's actioned, i.e. If read &gt; other and self &gt; other. If so, it first checks whether its simulated remote data was correct. If it was, it simply moves other up. If not, it rewinds to other (by loading the serialized state there) and runs the core in replay mode with the real data up to the least of self and read, then sets other to that.  To avoid latency building up, if the input from the network is too far ahead (i.e., unread is too far ahead of self), the frame limiter is momentarily disabled to catch up. Note that since network latency is expected, the normal case is the opposite: unread is behind self.</p> <p>When in netplay mode, the callback for receiving input is replaced by input_state_net. It is the role of input_state_net to combine the true local input (whether live or replay) with the remote input (whether true or simulated).</p> <p>Some thoughts about \"frame counts\": The frame counters act like indexes into a 0-indexed array; i.e., they refer to the first unactioned frame. So, when read_frame_count is 23, we've read 23 frames, but the last frame we read is frame 22. With self_frame_count it's slightly more complicated, since there are two relevant actions: Reading the data and emulating with the data. The frame count is only incremented after the latter, so there is a period of time during which we've actually read self_frame_count+1 frames of local input.</p> <p>Clients may come and go, and may start or stop playing even as they're connected. A client that is not playing is said to be spectating: It receives all the same data but sends none. A client may switch from spectating to playing by sending the appropriate request, at which point it is allotted a player number (see the SPECTATE, PLAY and MODE commands below).</p> <p>The server may also be in spectator mode, but as the server never sends data early (i.e., it only forwards data on the frame it's reached), it must also inform all clients of its own current frame even if it has no input. The NOINPUT command is provided for that purpose.</p>"},{"location":"development/retroarch/netplay/#protocol","title":"Protocol","text":"<p>A netplay connection involves a handshake, which assures that client and server are running the same software and brings the client to synchronization, and then an exchange of input packets.</p> <p>The handshake procedure (this part is done by both server and client): 1.

However, input latency is an option. The benefit of input latency is that the actual execution lags behind one's frame count, and thus it is more usual that remote data is available, and rewinding is both less frequent and less expensive.  There is an additional location in the state buffer, run, used when input latency is enabled. In that case, self points to where input is being read, and run points to the frame actually being executed. Run is purely local.</p>"},{"location":"development/retroarch/netplay/#command-format","title":"Command format","text":"<p>Netplay commands consist of a 32-bit command identifier, followed by a 32-bit payload size, both in network byte order, followed by a payload.

We see that <code>out_pixel[y][x]</code> isn\u2019t dependent on <code>out_pixel[y + k][x + k]</code>, so we see that we can parallelize quite a bit.</p> <p>Essentially, we only need to implement <code>process_pixel()</code> as a single function, which is called thousands, even millions of time every frame. The only purpose in life for <code>process_pixel()</code> is to process an input, and produce an output. No state is needed, thus, a \u201cpure\u201d function in computer science terms.</p> <p>For the Cg program, we need to implement two different functions. <code>main_vertex()</code> takes care of transforming every incoming vertex from camera space down to clip space. This essentially means projection of 3D (coordinates on GPU) down to 2D (your screen). Since we\u2019re dealing with old school emulators here, which are already 2D, the vertex shading is very trivial.</p> <p>Vertex shaders get various coordinates as input, and uniforms. Every vertex emitted by the emulator is run through <code>main_vertex</code> which calculates the final output position.

Think of it as a global variable that you\u2019re not allowed to change. Vertex shading can almost be ignored altogether, but since the vertex shader is run only 4 times, and the fragment shader is run millions of times per frame, it is a good idea to precalculate values in vertex shader that can later be used in fragment shader. There are some limitations to this which will be mentioned later.</p> <p><code>main_fragment()</code> takes care of calculating a pixel color for every single out-put pixel on the screen. If you\u2019re playing at 1080p, the fragment shader will have to be run <code>1920 * 1080</code> times! This is obviously straining on the GPU unless the shader is written efficiently.

We thus transform the input to the output with a matrix multiply with the current model-view projection. Since this matrix is the same for every vertex, it is a uniform. Remember that the variable names DO matter. modelViewProj has to be called exactly that, as the emulator will pass the MVP to this uniform. It is in the specification.</p> <p>Since we have semantics for the <code>POSITION</code>, etc, we can call them whatever we want, as the Cg environment figures out what the variables mean.</p> <p>The transformation happens here:</p> <pre><code>out_pos = mul(modelViewProj , pos);\n</code></pre> <p>The <code>COLOR</code> semantic isn\u2019t very interesting for us, but the example code in nVidias Cg documentation includes it, so we just follow along. <code>TEXCOORD</code> is the texture coordinate we get from the emulator, and generally we just pass it to the fragment shader directly. The coordinate will then be linearly interpolated across the fragments.</p> <p>More complex shaders can output (almost) as many variables they want, that will be linearily interpolated for free to the fragment shader. We also need a fragment shader to go along with the vertex shader, and here's a basic shader that only outputs the pixel as-is.

For example, classic pixel shaders look at the neighbor pixels as well to determine the output. But where is the neighbor pixel? We\u2019ll revise the fragment shader and try to make a really blurry shader to demonstrate. We now need to pull up some uniforms.

When he jumps out of the water, the water effect slowly fades away.</p> <p>We thus need to know two things:</p> <ul> <li>Is Mario currently in water or not?</li> <li>If not, how long time was it since he jumped out?</li> </ul> <p>Since shaders do not have state associated with it, we have to let the environment provide the state we need in a certain way. We\u2019ll call this concept a semantic. To capture a RAM value directly, we can use the \"capture\" semantic. To record the time when the RAM value last changed, we can use the \"transition\" semantic.</p> <p>We obviously also need to know where in RAM we can find this information. Luckily, the folks over at SMW Central know the answer. We see: <pre><code>$7E :0075 , byte , Flag , Player is in water flag. #$00 = No; #$01 = Yes.\n</code></pre></p> <p>Bank <code>$7E</code> and <code>$7F</code> are mapped to WRAM <code>$0000-$FFFF</code> and <code>$10000-$1FFFF</code> respectively. Thus, our WRAM address is <code>$0075</code>. In the config file, we can now set up the uniforms we\u2019ll want to be captured.</p> <pre><code>imports = \"mario_water ; mario_water_time\"\nmario_water_semantic = capture\n# Capture the RAM value as\u2212is.\nmario_water_wram = 0075\n# This value is hex!\nmario_water_time_semantic = transition\n# Capture the frame count when this variable last changed.\n# Use with IN. frame_count , to create a fade\u2212out effect.\nmario_water_time_wram = 0075\n</code></pre> <p>The amount of possible \"semantics\" are practically endless. It might be worthwhile to attempt some possibility to run custom code that keeps track of the shader uniforms in more sophisticated ways later on. Do note that there is also a <code>%s_mask</code> value which will let you bitmask the RAM value to check for bit-flags more easily.</p> <p>Now that we got that part down, let's work on the shader design. In the fragment shader we simply render both the full water effect, and the <code>\u00abnormal\u00bb</code> texture, and let a \"blend\" variable decide. We can say that <code>1.0</code> is full water effect, <code>0.0</code> is no effect. We can start working on our vertex shader. We will do something useful here for once.</p> <pre><code>struct input\n{\n  float frame_count;\n};\n\nvoid main_vertex (\n  float4 pos : POSITION,\n  out float4 out_pos : POSITION,\n  uniform float4x4 modelViewProj,\n  float4 color : COLOR,\n  out float4 out_color : COLOR,\n  float2 tex : TEXCOORD0,\n  out float2 out_tex : TEXCOORD0,\n  float2 tex1 : TEXCOORD1,\n  out float2 out_tex1 : TEXCOORD1,\n\n  // Even if the data should have been int, Cg doesn't seem to support integer uniforms\n  uniform float mario_water,\n  uniform float mario_water_time,\n  uniform input IN,\n  // Blend factor is passed to fragment shader.

Note that while they are known for arcade emulation, they can also emulate consoles and computers.</li> <li>Dump: A dump is the digital representation of 1 chip present on a game board/cartridge.</li> <li>Rom: A rom refers to 1 file containing 1 single dump or several dumps concatenated together.</li> <li>Romset: Literally \"rom set\", meaning a set of roms. A romset is an archive containing one or several individual rom(s), arcade emulators expect this game format.</li> <li>Romset version: It's not unusual for a specific romset to exist in different versions. The reason for this is that sometimes the attempts at digitalizing chips failed, and instead of having a game totally unavailable due to a romset being only 90% complete, it was decided to implement workarounds in the emulator's code to make the game somehow playable. Every time one of those chips finally gets a proper dump, which can happen decades later, ongoing arcade emulators will update their code by removing the workarounds and loading the correct dump, hence why multiple romset versions can exist.</li> <li>Samples: Sometimes, instead of emulating the sound coming from the actual board of a game, an emulator will use recorded sounds. There can be several reasons for this : the chips weren't dumped, the emulator doesn't emulate that sound board (yet), or the emulator allows as an alternative to replace that emulation by high quality sound coming from another source (OST, ...).</li> <li>CHD: Some arcade games require data from an internal hard drive, CD-ROM, laserdisk, or other media in order to be emulated -- those forms of media are packaged as CHD files. CHD files should be copied to subfolders (going by the name of the romset) within the folder where the arcade romset has been installed.</li> </ul> <p>Additionally, there exist different kind of romsets :</p> <ul> <li>Bios romset: A romset containing bioses required to run an arcade system. For example, the <code>neogeo</code> romset contains the bioses required to run SNK's NeoGeo cartridge system.</li> <li>Parent romset: There can be multiple revisions of an arcade cabinet, the parent romset is usually the one dumped from the arcade cabinet which is believed to be the most recent revision, which is often a world or europe version. Parent romsets might require a bios romset to work.</li> <li>Clone romset: Either dumped from arcade cabinet revisions believed to be older, or unofficial revisions of that arcade cabinet (bootlegs, hacks). Clone romsets might require a parent to work.</li> <li>Full non-merged romset: The romset can be used standalone because the archive contains all the files required to run that romset, including any roms from its parent and bios romsets.</li> <li>Non-merged romset: The romset can be used standalone because the archive contains all the files required to run that game, including any roms from its parent romset. With this format, a separate bios romset might be needed to run the romset.</li> <li>Split romset: With this format, a clone romset never contains any of the roms present in its parent romset, and a parent romset never contains any of the roms present in its bios romset (if it exists).</li> <li>Merged romset: Clones are merged into the parent romset zip, meaning that more than one game is stored in the romset.</li> </ul> <p>ClrMamePro users</p> <p>To rebuild Full Non-Merged romsets, use <code>Non-Merged</code> mode and deselect <code>Separate BIOS sets</code> via the <code>Advanced</code> button in the <code>Rebuild</code> and <code>Scanner</code> menus.

This affects pressure-sensitive triggers on controllers like PlayStation 2 and later, making some games unplayable due to the lack of analog input.</p> <p>SDL2 is an exception to this issue: SDL2 treats triggers like L2 and R2 as axes, even if they are digital buttons, to keep a consistent interface across controllers. For example, the Nintendo Switch Pro Controller\u2019s triggers are digital but SDL2 maps them as axes, with values jumping from 0 to max instantly. In the SDL2 Nintendo Switch Pro Controller.cfg file, this is reflected by lines like:</p> <pre><code>input_l2_axis = \"+4\"\ninput_r2_axis = \"+5\"\ninput_l2_axis_label = \"ZL\"\ninput_r2_axis_label = \"ZR\"\n</code></pre> <p>To address this bug in RetroArch on other controllers or drivers, you need to manually edit the RetroArch config file to set the correct analog axis mappings for L2 and R2. Here's how to find the proper axis values:</p> <ul> <li>Install and run jstest avalible for GNU/Linux (<code>sudo apt-get install joystick</code> for Debian-like distros), and Windows.</li> <li>In GNU/Linux: <code>jstest /dev/input/js0</code></li> <li>In GNU/Linux virtual machines using QEMU, js0 is designated for the mouse, so you need to use js1 by running the command: <code>jstest /dev/input/js1</code></li> <li>Slowly press L2 and R2 to identify which axis numbers change</li> <li>Note the axis numbers that correspond to L2 and R2</li> <li>In the autoconfig file, set: <pre><code>input_l2_axis = \"+X\"  (where X is the L2 axis number)\ninput_r2_axis = \"+Y\"  (where Y is the R2 axis number)\n\ninput_l2_axis_label = \"L2 Trigger\"\ninput_r2_axis_label = \"R2 Trigger\"\n</code></pre></li> </ul> <p>For example, if L2 is axis 2 and R2 is axis 5, you would:</p> <p>Replace: <pre><code>input_l2_btn = \"6\"\ninput_r2_btn = \"7\"\n\ninput_l2_btn_label = \"L2\"\ninput_r2_btn_label = \"R2\"\n</code></pre></p> <p>With <pre><code>input_l2_axis = \"+2\"\ninput_r2_axis = \"+5\"\n\ninput_l2_axis_label = \"L2 Trigger\"\ninput_r2_axis_label = \"R2 Trigger\"\n</code></pre></p> <p>Note: These variable values are examples and should not be directly copied to your configuration file.</p> <p>When modifying your autoconfig file for analog triggers, it's crucial to pay attention to both variable names and values. The corresponding label variable names must also be consistent to ensure the configuration works correctly. A common oversight is focusing solely on the values while neglecting to update the variable names themselves. The <code>_axis</code> suffix is essential for ensuring proper analog functionality. Simply changing values without updating the suffix from <code>_btn</code> to <code>_axis</code> will not achieve the desired result.</p>"},{"location":"guides/controller-autoconfiguration/#common-pitfall","title":"Common Pitfall","text":"<p>Users often unintentionally incorporate analog variable values without properly adjusting the existing variable names to reflect their analog nature.

For correct synchronization, <code>Settings-&gt;Video-&gt;Output-&gt;Vertical Refresh Rate</code> must be configured for your display. It cannot be detected accurately enough by OS-provided APIs (i.e. they tend to blatantly lie). For proper behavior, an accuracy of roughly ~0.1% is needed for dynamic rate control to smooth out the drifting. This is trivial to obtain by measuring manually under normal conditions. Without dynamic rate control one would need a \"perfect\" measurement which obviously isn't possible without special hardware.</p> <p>RetroArch gives you an estimate of your display's refresh rate at <code>Settings-&gt;Video-&gt;Output-&gt;Estimated Screen Refresh Rate</code>, which is updated in real-time using a running average over frame times. Make sure VSync is enabled and working. Also make sure you're running in full-screen for more accurate results (compositors can easily interfere with timing). Press accept button on the estimated refresh rate to configure RetroArch with the estimated rate. If the running average isn't drifting much anymore, it's probably a good result.</p> <p>You can also have RetroArch log the output at the end and configure things more manually.

Some systems tend to have very unreliable VSync behavior and this result will wildly fluctuate. You can use this value in <code>Vertical Refresh Rate</code> and the video and audio should ideally be exceptionally smooth without any static or 'popping' audio.

Adjusting these settings in a haphazard fashion or adjusting more than one at a time can lead to skipping over a correct solution by fixing one part of the problem while simultaneously breaking another part. If instead it does work afterwards, then it can lead to an inability to determine which change actually contributed to success.</p> <p>The next section is an attempt at a step by step guide to configuring and diagnosing most frame pacing related settings. It is ordered starting from the most critical and directly audio/visual synchronization related settings first and continues towards settings that have other uses and effects, yet also impact synchronization, farther down. You can skip over any configuration changes you are unwilling to compromise on just for possibly improved frame pacing, or stop after any point in the process that you are satisfied with the output, of course. </p> <p>If you want to be able to judge the impact of a setting change by more than just 'eyeballing' the results, RetroArch provides a running statistics HUD by toggling <code>Settings-&gt;User Interface-&gt;On-Screen Display-&gt;On-Screen Notifications-&gt;Notification Visibility-&gt;Display Statistics</code>. You can also use an external program to monitor frame pacing, but keep in mind just the act of running it is possibly introducing a small amount of jitter itself.</p> <p>Notable internal RetroArch statistics regarding frame pacing are:</p> <ul> <li> <p>Core AV_INFO-&gt;FPS - The exact frame timing the core is requesting.</p> </li> <li> <p>Video-&gt;Refresh - What your <code>Settings-&gt;Video-&gt;Output-&gt;Vertical Refresh Rate</code> is currently set to.</p> </li> <li> <p>Video-&gt;FPS - The rate at which you are currently outputting actual frames. With VRR on, this should match <code>Core AV_INFO-&gt;FPS</code>, and with VRR off, this should be very close to <code>Settings-&gt;Video-&gt;Output-Vertical Refresh Rate</code> divided by <code>Vsync Swap Interval</code> after the averaging settles. If <code>Video-&gt;FPS</code> is far above these values, possibilities include your Vsync or your VRR settings are not engaging properly, depending on which you are using, while having <code>Settings-&gt;Audio-&gt;Synchronization-&gt;Synchronization</code> disabled. If instead <code>Video-&gt;FPS</code> is substantially beneath, possibilities include Swap Interval set wrong, or your hardware not being able to keep up with the system demands. Note that neither <code>Video-&gt;FPS</code> nor <code>Core AV_INFO-&gt;FPS</code> will display 30 for 30 fps content most of the time, as internal frame doubling is performed.</p> </li> <li> <p>Audio-&gt;Underrun - This keeps track of the amount of time slices over a recent period that the audio buffer is near emptying. If this value settles at a percentage higher than 0%, after running for a while (and without menu access, slow motion, or fast forward having recently been used), you can use this to diagnose that the audio and video aren't in great sync, as the audio is not keeping up with the video. In this situation RetroArch will either occasionally stutter briefly to maintain sync, or if <code>Settings-&gt;Audio-&gt;Synchronization-&gt;Synchronization</code> is off, you will get static and popping audio noises.</p> </li> <li> <p>Audio-&gt;Blocking - The opposite of <code>Audio-&gt;Underrun</code> in practice. This time, if it settles at a percentage higher than 0%, after running for a while (and again, without menu access, slow motion, or fast forward having recently been used), it means the audio is running ahead of the video.</p> <p>Note that on some cores it is possible to have moderate amounts of both Underrun and Blocking present while your hardware is capable of performing at full core requested speed and all settings are correct, but this is more common for actual variable framerate content that tends to be more present from the 5<sup>th</sup> generation of consoles on. So it might be best to test your overall settings with an earlier generation, less complex core. </p> </li> </ul>"},{"location":"guides/optimal-vsync/#advanced-configuration-step-by-step-guide","title":"Advanced Configuration Step-By-Step Guide","text":"<ol> <li> <p>Choose one of the following synchronization methods depending on whether your screen is capable of Variable Refresh Rate (VRR) and if you want to use it:</p> <ul> <li> <p>For synchronization without VRR, you should set <code>Settings-&gt;Video-&gt;Output-&gt;Vertical Refresh Rate</code> very close to an evenly divisible multiple of the core requested refresh rate, still using <code>Settings-&gt;Video-&gt;Output-&gt;Estimated Screen Refresh Rate</code> to get a more accurate value as mentioned in the Basic Configuration section. You should end up with a value right around 60/120/180/240/etc Hz for NTSC, 50/100/150/200/etc for PAL. Uneven, but fairly common, display refresh rates like 75/90/144/165 Hz are only able to maintain smooth frame pacing and audio synchronization while <code>Variable Refresh Rate (VRR)</code> is active, which is discussed below.</p> <p>Setting your actual display refresh rate to 60Hz, and then configuring the real refresh rate as per the Basic Configuration section, combined with a complementary <code>Vsync Swap Interval</code> of 1, will always be the most default and thus supported mode of operation to obtain perfect frame timing. But if you want to be able to run RetroArch on your &gt;60Hz display without having to lower the actual screen refresh rate, this section explains how to do so correctly with minimized chance of issues.</p> <p>After you have verified the rate is set appropriately, you should check under <code>System-&gt;Video Settings-&gt;Synchronization</code> and make sure that <code>Vertical Sync (Vsync)</code> is on, and set the <code>Vsync Swap Interval</code> to either <code>Auto</code>, which will try to determine the right value for your applied refresh rate on its own, or you can manually set the value yourself. Unless you note specific issues with your system, <code>Auto</code> is likely the superior choice, as it will avoid the 'math problem' required for manual configuration and respond to changes in others settings including <code>Black Frame Insertion</code> and <code>Sync to Exact Content Framerate (G-Sync, Freesync)</code> without needing to be updated again itself. </p> <p>If you choose to set it manually, the value you should set it to is the value such that when you divide <code>Settings-&gt;Video-&gt;Output-Vertical Refresh Rate</code> by it, gives you a result near your 60/50Hz goal. I.e. 60Hz/1 = 60Hz, so set <code>Vsync Swap Interval</code> to 1. 120Hz/2 = 60Hz, so set <code>Vsync Swap Interval</code> to 2, 180Hz/3 = 60Hz so set <code>Vsync Swap Interval</code> to 3, and so on.</p> <p>Lastly, when syncing with this method to a value other than <code>Auto</code> or 1, ensure that <code>Black Frame Insertion</code> is off, and that <code>Sync to Exact Content Framerate (G-Sync, Freesync)</code> is off. These are each separate methods to sync the display and audio, and they should not be combined.</p> </li> <li> <p>For a VRR capable display, configuring settings is less error prone, at least inside of RetroArch, and also has a benefit of being able to sync to the exact originally intended speed of the core. <code>Settings-&gt;Video-&gt;Output-&gt;Vertical Refresh Rate</code> will not be in use to attempt to adjust the timing, and is not required to be set correctly, but it is still good practice.</p> <p>To setup RetroArch to use VRR timing, turn on <code>Sync to Exact Content Rate (G-Sync, Freesync)</code> under <code>System-&gt;Video Settings-&gt;Synchronization</code>, and verify <code>Vsync Swap Interval</code> is set to either 1 or Auto, and that <code>Black Frame Insertion</code> is off. Just as above, these settings should not be combined.</p> </li> </ul> </li> <li> <p>Ensure <code>Settings-&gt;Audio-&gt;Synchronization-&gt;Synchronization</code> is enabled. Also in this same menu, for a non-VRR setup, <code>Maximum Timing Skew</code> will decide how far Retroarch will be willing to adjust the core requested speed to attempt to sync with your refresh and swap interval settings.</p> <p>For the most part, the default value will be fine, but some arcade content runs at Hz significantly farther in the middle between 50Hz and 60Hz. The older Mortal Kombat arcade machines request a rate around 54Hz, for instance. Further, if you desire to run 50Hz PAL content at 60Hz NTSC speed, you must set the maximum skew even higher. 60Hz NTSC is ~17% faster than 50Hz PAL, so you would want to set the <code>Maximum Timing Skew</code> to .17. Note that a higher maximum will not cause content that is not far from your set refresh rate to run at a less correct speed, it will only allow content that is farther away to sync so that you can obtain smooth frame pacing and audio.</p> </li> <li> <p>Check Display Control Panel and Other External Program Settings</p> <ul> <li> <p>Make sure you are not overriding application settings to force <code>Vsync</code> off. </p> </li> <li> <p>Check if you decided to use VRR in step 1.</p> <ul> <li> <p>If you aren't using VRR, and have a maximum framerate cap set (in the driver or through a third party software tool like RTSS), verify that it is at least as high as the set refresh rate of your display. You might think a 60 fps cap would be all you need for 60 fps content, but a display set to 240Hz using a swap interval of 4, still needs 240 potential vblanks per second to sync correctly to 60 actual fps.</p> </li> <li> <p>If you are using VRR, you must verify that it enabled at the display driver level, and on the display as well. Also you should ensure, if you have a configured maximum framerate cap, that it is set slightly above 60 at the least, not right at 60. NTSC NES/SNES request 60.1Hz for instance, and this could interfere with proper frame timing even with VRR, if you have a 60 fps framerate cap.</p> </li> </ul> </li> <li> <p>If your system has a strong GPU and it is available for your display driver, consider looking for a setting similar to <code>Power Management Mode</code> and configure it for <code>Prefer Maximum Performance</code>, either globally or specifically for RetroArch.</p> <p>Some higher powered GPU's are designed to downclock on lower loads by default, which they may see RetroArch as. If your GPU can stay in this downclocked state while maintaining full performance, there might not be any interference with smooth synchronization. However, if instead if it responds to RetroArch as a load where it constantly shifts back and forth between a high power state and a low power state, this can cause inconsistent frame times.</p> </li> <li> <p>Consider disabling possibly unnecessary overlays like from RTSS, Discord, or Steam. RTSS has been known with previous versions, for instance, to cause issues with Vulkan in Retroarch, even when not running, just merely by being installed! For reference: Vulkan Frame Pacing Stutter</p> </li> <li> <p>Active video recording or streaming software has the potential to interfere with perfect frame pacing, but if your stream or recording is important, obviously perfect frame pacing will have to become a secondary concern. Just set all other settings as appropriately as you can.</p> </li> </ul> </li> <li> <p>Back inside of RetroArch consider adjusting settings that can have an impact on frame pacing and synchronization.</p> <ul> <li> <p>Windowed mode, and even windowed full-screen mode can contribute to frame pacing issues, so <code>Settings-&gt;Video-&gt;Fullscreen Mode-&gt;Windowed Full-Screen Mode</code> can be disabled to test if this improves your frame pacing.</p> </li> <li> <p><code>Settings-&gt;Video-&gt;Output-&gt;Automatic Refresh Rate Switch</code> can be considered to be disabled, as if it changes your actual display refresh rate, in non-VRR mode this can interfere with your set Vsync Swap Interval and cause large mistiming, and in VRR mode, you want the display to maintain the maximum potential refresh rate so that it can be more accurate in accomodating small requested timing differences.</p> </li> <li> <p><code>Settings-&gt;Video-&gt;Output-&gt;Threaded Video</code> is well known to interfere with smooth frame pacing and audio sync, but can be the only choice for hardware otherwise too weak for the intended content to run at near the correct frame rate at all.</p> </li> <li> <p>Using a very heavy shader like an accurate CRT emulation shader, especially on a higher resolution display, can also increase performance requirements to obtain smooth synchronization.</p> </li> <li> <p>Your preferred renderer API of Vulkan/OpenGL/DirectX 11/etc might not interact perfectly with your system or the core you are using, and you can try an alternative.</p> </li> <li> <p>Core specific settings can be checked for things such as overclocks which can increase system requirements to where you might not be able to run full speed, or internal run-ahead, or frame duplication.</p> </li> <li> <p>Under <code>Settings-&gt;Latency</code>, <code>Frame Delay (ms)</code>, <code>Automatic Frame Delay</code>, <code>Run-Ahead to Reduce Latency</code> and <code>Run Pre-Emptive Frames</code> should be adjusted down or off if smooth frame pacing is a priority for you over latency and you continue to have issues at this point in the process.  These settings can cause inability to reach proper sync if your system can not handle the increased load or they are simply set too high even on very capable hardware.</p> </li> <li> <p><code>Settings-Latency-&gt;Audio Latency</code> perhaps unintuitively should be kept higher, not lower. Too low of an audio latency causes RetroArch to stutter while waiting to refill the now smaller audio buffer when <code>Settings-&gt;Audio-&gt;Synchronization-&gt;Synchronization</code> is enabled, or can cause very poor audio output when <code>Settings-&gt;Audio-&gt;Synchronization-&gt;Synchronization</code> is not set.</p> <p>How low you can set this to without issue can vary per content, but the default value of 64 ms was chosen for avoiding issues like this. If you still decide to push lower, keep in mind a 60Hz NTSC frame is approximately 16.66 ms long, so you might want to try a value a little longer than 2 frames, like 35ms, and then a little longer than 3 frames like 52ms, et cetera.</p> </li> <li> <p>Under <code>System-&gt;Video Settings-&gt;Synchronization</code>, <code>Hard GPU Sync</code>, <code>Max Swapchain Images</code>, or <code>Waitable Swapchains</code>, any of which might be available with your current renderer API, are designed to reduce latency by limiting how many frames ahead that the cpu can calculate beyond the currently displayed frame. If you are still experiencing frame pacing issues having reached this poing in the document, and care more about that than increased latency, you can disable <code>Hard GPU Sync</code>, <code>Waitable Swapchains</code>, or increase the value of <code>Max Swapchain Images</code> to give your system more performance headroom.</p> </li> </ul> </li> </ol>"},{"location":"guides/optimal-vsync/#further-considerations","title":"Further Considerations","text":"<p>If you've gone through all the above, there is not much more to configure settings-wise. It is possible your hardware is just not capable of running the desired content at full speed. You can try to see if an alternative core exists for your content that is perhaps designed to run on lower specification hardware than the one you were previously using. Also (though no specific offenders will be named as this can change for better or worse with any core update any given day) some content on some cores simply have somewhat poorer timing control. Odds are higher of finding this on 5<sup>th</sup> generation and beyond console cores that are dealing with content that ran at very unstable framerates on original hardware. </p> <p>Lastly, a couple things to keep in mind that don't fit neatly in any section above without being a large digression:</p> <ul> <li> <p>Most VRR displays have a feature called Low Framerate Compensation (LFC). What this means is that there is a minimum fps below which VRR can no longer actually sync, and it will compensate for this with , depending on display implementation, a combination of internal frame doubling and screen tearing. If this rate is right near the output rate, and some 240Hz+ displays are indeed coming with a LFC minimum rate directly around 60 as of this writing, you can experience significant impact on frame pacing. 30 fps content will also be below this LFC rate on a large number of VRR displays, but if it is a very stable 30 fps and the display has a good frame doubling algorithm, this might not be an issue.</p> <p>If you check your display specifications and believe you are experiencing LFC related issues, you might well be better served using a fixed refresh rate for RetroArch. Note that you should not have to disable VRR in your display driver or on your display, just discontinue use of <code>Sync to Exact Content Rate (G-Sync, Freesync)</code> inside Retroarch, and instead follow the instructions above for using <code>Vsync Swap Interval</code> to sync.   </p> </li> <li> <p>It has been noted previously that for macOS, that having more than one display active can cause interference with obtaining good frame pacing and audio synchronization. This can be extended as a possible solution to try regardless of operating system. Relatedly, it is potentially helpful if you do leave multiple displays active, to leave them all set to the same refresh rate.</p> <p>Also, running videos or other screen updating content at the same time on a secondary display is a potential source of issues. Windows 10/11 compositor handles multiple active contents like this better as of writing than in the past, but this could change at any point and there are also a multitude of other Operating Systems and devices that will have their own possible compositor issues with running multiple separate contents simultaneously.</p> </li> </ul> <p>Thanks for reading, and have a smooth day!</p>"},{"location":"guides/overlay-pointing-devices/","title":"Overlay Mouse, Lightgun, and Pointer","text":"<p>When using an overlay, RetroArch can send pointing device input alongside gamepad input using <code>Enable Overlay Lightgun, Mouse, and Pointer</code> in the <code>On-Screen Overlay</code> menu.</p> <p>This allows more natural control of lightgun overlays, emulated touchscreens, mouse-controlled first-person shooters, and anything else requiring simultaneous button + pointer input.</p> <p>Note: This overrides any platform-specific touchscreen controls, which might behave differently.</p>"},{"location":"guides/overlay-pointing-devices/#mouse-behavior","title":"Mouse behavior","text":"<p>Dragging 1 finger moves the mouse cursor. 1-, 2-, and 3-finger taps are left, right, and middle mouse button clicks.</p> <p>By default, a 0.2s long press begins holding a button, and you'll feel haptic feedback when it starts.

While you are capable of using the full canvas, a 248x248 or 240x240 maximum icon size is highly recommended. Alternatively, you can keep your icons inside a 256x256 circular \"blueprint\". This will keep the top and the bottom of your icons from touching when you're scrolling through a list of icons.</p> </li> <li> <p>Create and stick to a color palette of 64 colors or less. While you can use an unlimited palette, your icons will look more uniform and consistent as a theme.</p> </li> <li> <p>Keep the details of your icons in harmony with one another. If one icon has too many design details, try to simplify it to match with the other icons. If an icon is lacking in detail, do what you can to add balance in comparison to the other designs.</p> </li> </ul> <p>Here's a complete list of icons (and wallpaper) in the default set.

Synchronizing like this is a very demanding task timing-wise and dynamic rate control helps smooth out imperfections in timing which are guaranteed to arise. It can be disabled, but be aware that proper video/audio sync is nearly impossible to obtain.</p> <p>While using RetroArch, the default settings might not be adequate, and you might experience video stuttering and/or audio crackling. For correct synchronization, video_refresh_rate must be configured for your monitor. It cannot be detected accurately enough by OS-provided APIs (i.e. they tend to blatantly lie). For proper behavior, an accuracy of roughly ~0.1% is needed for dynamic rate control to smooth out the drifting. This is trivial to obtain by measuring manually under normal conditions. Without dynamic rate control one would need a \"perfect\" measurement which obviously isn't possible without special hardware.</p> <p>RetroArch can give you an estimate of your monitors refresh rate under video settings, which is updated in real-time using a running average over frame times. Make sure vysnc is enabled and working. Also make sure you're running in full-screen for more accurate results (compositors can easily interfere with timing). Press accept button on the estimated refresh rate to configure RetroArch with the estimated rate. If the running average isn't drifting much anymore, it's probably a good result.</p> <p>You can also have RetroArch log the output at the end and configure things more manually. Start RetroArch directly in RGUI with retroarch --verbose --menu. Let it run uninterrupted for at least 4096 frames (displayed in title bar), and exit. In the log, you should see something like:</p> <pre><code>RetroArch: Average monitor Hz: 59.869485 Hz. (1.347 % frame time deviation, based on 2048 last samples).\n</code></pre> <p>If you're unsure about the result, run this test several times and see if the results are consistent. Some systems tend to have very unreliable vsync behavior and this result will wildly fluctuate. You can use this value in <code>video_refresh_rate</code> and the video and audio should ideally be butter smooth if the game's FPS and monitor FPS are relatively close to each other. Playing a PAL game on 60 Hz monitor won't be perfect no matter what you do, however.</p>"},{"location":"guides/troubleshooting-retroarch/#threaded-video","title":"Threaded video","text":"<p>If your video driver has very bad performance, it is possible to run it on a thread to avoid almost all video driver overhead.

If you are annoyed by this problem, and still want to play in windowed mode, you should use the D3D driver which doesn't have this problem. Disabling Aero sometimes helps OpenGL VSync behavior.</p>"},{"location":"guides/troubleshooting-retroarch/#input-latency","title":"Input latency","text":"<p>There have been cases reported on excessive input lag in Windows for some users. It's not really input latency, but video driver latency. Some video drivers tend to buffer way too much in the name of increased performance. This problem is explained by Carmack here.</p> <p>RetroArch recently got an option to use a swap/fence sync method in OpenGL driver, which is reported to greatly lower input latency (thread). To enable it, set video_hard_sync = true in config or enable it from RGUI. To ensure that this sync method is actually used, make sure that you see this in the log:</p> <pre><code>RetroArch: Querying GL extension: ARB_sync =&gt; exists\nRetroArch: [GL]: Using ARB_sync to reduce latency.\n</code></pre> <p>Do note that this sync method can greatly reduce performance, and can turn smooth 60 fps into crawling 30 fps if there was not enough headroom in the performance. If you use KMS mode, using <code>video_hard_sync</code> won't help as it already does something like this.</p>"},{"location":"guides/troubleshooting-retroarch/#why-isnt-my-bios-working","title":"Why isn\u2019t my BIOS working?","text":"<ol> <li>Make sure the BIOS files are placed into the correct directory</li> <li>Make sure they are named correctly so the core can identify them.</li> <li>Make sure it\u2019s the correct version/region of a BIOS.</li> <li>Make sure your files are not corrupted (bad source, broken download, etc.).</li> <li>Make sure to check the log for any errors.</li> </ol>"},{"location":"guides/troubleshooting-retroarch/#getting-ready-to-ask-for-help","title":"Getting ready to ask for help","text":"<p>When problems arise with RetroArch, it is helpful for the developers and other volunteers to have certain standard information in order to find a solution.

The \"4:3\" setting should not be used and is only provided as a legacy feature for users desiring old incorrect behavior from the core.</p> </li> <li> <p>Widescreen Mode Hack [beetle_psx_widescreen_hack] (disabled/enabled)</p> <p>Forces content to be rendered with an aspect ratio of 16:9. Produces best results with fully 3D games. Can cause graphical glitches or alignment/stretching issues in games that mix 3D and 2D elements. Leave off for most games.</p> Widescreen mode hack - Off <p></p> Widescreen mode hack - On <p></p> </li> <li> <p>Crop Horizontal Overscan [beetle_psx_crop_overscan] (enabled/disabled)</p> <p>By default, Beetle PSX includes horizontal padding (black bars or 'pillarboxes' on either side of the screen) to emulate the same black bars generated in analog video output by real PSX hardware. This horizontal padding can contain garbage pixels that are generated when the game's width mode is smaller than the display area width in the emulated GPU registers. Enabling 'Crop Horizontal Overscan' will remove this potentially glitchy horizontal overscan region.</p> <p>Not all games will benefit from enabling this setting as shown in the examples below.</p> Crop Overscan - Off (Game with Garbage Pixels) <p></p> Crop Overscan - On (Game with Garbage Pixels) <p></p> Crop Overscan - Off (Game with No Issues) <p></p> Crop Overscan - On (Game with No Issues) <p></p> <p>This option does not affect vertical overscan. Vertical overscan can be cropped using the Initial/Last Scanline core options.</p> </li> <li> <p>Additional Cropping [beetle_psx_image_crop] (disabled/1px/2px/3px/4px/5px/6px/7px/8px)</p> <p>When 'Crop Horizontal Overscan' is enabled, this option further reduces the width of the cropped image by the specified number of pixels.</p> <p>Note: This can have unintended consequences. While the absolute width is reduced, the resultant video is still scaled to the currently set aspect ratio. Enabling 'Additional Cropping' may therefore cause horizontal stretching.</p> </li> <li> <p>Offset Cropped Image [beetle_psx_image_offset] (disabled/-4px/-3px/-2px/-1px/+1px/+2px/+3px/+4px)</p> <p>When 'Crop Horizontal Overscan' is enabled, allows the resultant cropped image to be offset horizontally to the right (positive) or left (negative) by the specified number of pixels. May be used to correct alignment issues.</p> </li> <li> <p>Initial Scanline - NTSC [beetle_psx_initial_scanline] (0 to 40 in increments of 1. Default: 0)</p> <p>Selects the first displayed scanline when running NTSC content. Setting a value greater than 0 will reduce the height of output images by cropping pixels from the topmost edge. May be used to counteract letterboxing built in to some games.</p> </li> <li> <p>Last Scanline - NTSC [beetle_psx_last_scanline] (210 to 239 in increments of 1. Default: 239)</p> <p>Selects the last displayed scanline when running NTSC content. Setting a value less than 239 will reduce the height of output images by cropping pixels from the bottommost edge. May be used to counteract letterboxing built in to some games.</p> </li> <li> <p>Initial Scanline - PAL [beetle_psx_initial_scanline_pal] (0 to 40 in increments of 1. Default: 0)</p> <p>Selects the first displayed scanline when running PAL content. Setting a value greater than 0 will reduce the height of output images by cropping pixels from the topmost edge. May be used to counteract letterboxing built in to some games.</p> </li> <li> <p>Last Scanline - PAL [beetle_psx_last_scanline_pal] (230 to 287 in increments of 1. Default: 287)</p> <p>Selects the last displayed scanline when running PAL content. Setting a value less than 287 will reduce the height of output images by cropping pixels from the bottommost edge. May be used to counteract letterboxing built in to some games.</p> </li> <li> <p>CD Access Method (Restart) [beetle_psx_cd_access_method] (sync/async/precache)</p> <p>Selects method used to read data from content disc images.</p> <p>'sync' emulates original hardware.</p> <p>'async' can alleviate stuttering on devices with slow storage.</p> <p>'precache' loads the entire disc image into memory when starting content, incurring a small startup delay. This can improve in-game loading times and eliminate stutters due to emulated CD access, but may cause issues on systems with low memory.</p> </li> <li> <p>CD Loading Speed [beetle_psx_cd_fastload] (2x(native)/4x/6x/8x/10x/12x/14x)</p> <p>Selects disk access speed multiplier.</p> <p>This speedhack can greatly reduce loading times at speeds higher than native but is known to introduce texture corruption errors, timing glitches, or loading screen softlocks in many titles. Some games will not work at all if loading speed is not set to native (e.g. Castlevania: Symphony of the Night).</p> <p>Reduce multiplier value if experiencing loading issues, freezes, etc.</p> </li> <li> <p>Memory Card 0 Method (Restart) [beetle_psx_use_mednafen_memcard0_method] (libretro/mednafen)</p> <p>Choose the savedata format used for Memory Card 0. See the Saves section above for an explanation regarding the libretro and mednafen formats. libretro is recommended, but mednafen may be used for compatibility with the standalone version of Mednafen. The libretro (.srm) and Mednafen (.mcr) formats are internally identical when used with Beetle PSX.</p> <p>Note: This option must be set to 'mednafen' if the Shared Memcards option is enabled.</p> </li> <li> <p>Enable Memory Card 1 (Restart) [beetle_psx_enable_memcard1] (enabled/disabled)</p> <p>Selects whether to emulate a second memory card in Slot 1. When disabled, games can only access the memory card in Slot 0.</p> <p>Note: Some games require this option to be disabled for correct operation (e.g. Codename Tenka).</p> </li> <li> <p>Shared Memory Cards (Restart) [beetle_psx_shared_memory_cards] (disabled/enabled)</p> <p>When enabled, games will save and load using the same memory card files. Note: The \"Memcard 0 Method\" option must be set to 'mednafen' for this option to function properly.</p> <p>When disabled, separate memory card files will be generated for each title.</p> <p>This option is useful for games in series such as Suikoden or Arc the Lad that check for save data from previous titles.</p> </li> </ul> <p> Memcard slot 0 Memcard slot 1 mednafen_psx_libretro_shared.0.mcr mednafen_psx_libretro_shared.1.mcr <p></p> <ul> <li> <p>Analog Self-Calibration [beetle_psx_analog_calibration] (disabled/enabled)</p> <p>When enabled, monitors the max values reached by the input, using it as a calibration heuristic which then scales the analog coordinates sent to the emulator accordingly. For best results, rotate the sticks at max amplitude for the algorithm to get a good estimate of the scaling factor, otherwise it will adjust while playing.</p> <p>While modern analog sticks have circular logical ranges, older analog sticks such as those on the DualShock have logical ranges closer to squares and can report larger values at the intercardinal directions than modern analog sticks can. Games that expect these larger values will have issues controlling with modern analog sticks, which this option can solve by scaling modern analog stick values up.</p> </li> <li> <p>Enable DualShock Analog Mode Toggle [beetle_psx_analog_toggle] (disabled/enabled)</p> <p>When the input device type is set to DualShock, this option determines whether or not the Analog Button on that device can be toggled.</p> <p>When this option is disabled, the DualShock input device will be locked in Analog Mode where the analog sticks are on.</p> <p>When this option is enabled, the DualShock input device can be toggled between Digital Mode (analog sticks off) and Analog Mode (analog sticks on) much like real hardware by pressing and holding START+SELECT+L1+L2+R1+R2 for one second in lieu of a dedicated Analog Button.</p> <p>Note: Some games may not respond to input when the DualShock is in Analog Mode. Either enable Analog Button Toggle and toggle the DualShock to Digital Mode or change your input device type to PlayStation Controller.</p> </li> <li> <p>Port 1: Multitap Enable [beetle_psx_enable_multitap_port1] (disabled/enabled)</p> <p>Enables/Disables multitap functionality on port 1.</p> </li> <li> <p>Port 2: Multitap Enable [beetle_psx_enable_multitap_port2] (disabled/enabled)</p> <p>Enables/Disables multitap functionality on port 2.</p> </li> <li> <p>Gun Input Mode [beetle_psx_gun_input_mode] (lightgun/touchscreen)</p> <p>When device type is set to 'Guncon / G-Con 45' or 'Justifier', specify whether to use a mouse-controlled 'Light Gun' or 'Touchscreen' input.</p> </li> <li> <p>Gun Cursor [beetle_psx_gun_cursor] (cross/dot/off)</p> <p>Selects the gun cursor to be displayed on screen while using the the 'Guncon / G-Con 45' and 'Justifier' input device types. When disabled, cross hairs are always hidden.</p> Gun Cursor - Cross <p></p> Gun Cursor - Dot <p></p> Gun Cursor - Off <p></p> </li> <li> <p>Mouse Sensitivity [beetle_psx_mouse_sensitivity] (5% to 200% in increments of 5%. Default: 100%)</p> <p>Configure the response of the 'Mouse' input device type.</p> </li> <li> <p>NegCon Twist Response [beetle_psx_negcon_response] (linear/quadratic/cubic)</p> <p>Specifies the analog response when using a RetroPad left analog stick to simulate the 'twist' action of emulated neGcon Controllers.</p> <p>'linear': Analog stick displacement is mapped linearly to negCon rotation angle.</p> <p>'quadratic': Analog stick displacement is mapped quadratically to negCon rotation angle. This allows for greater precision when making small movements with the analog stick.</p> <p>'cubic': Analog stick displacement is mapped cubically to negCon rotation angle. This allows for even greater precision when making small movements with the analog stick, but 'exaggerates' larger movements.</p> <p>Attention</p> <p>A linear response is not recommended when using standard gamepad devices. The negCon 'twist' mechanism is substantially different from conventional analog sticks; linear mapping over-amplifies small displacements of the stick, impairing fine control. A linear response is only appropriate when using racing wheel peripherals.</p> <p>In most cases, the 'quadratic' option should be selected. This provides effective compensation for the physical differences between real/emulated hardware and is the closest approximation of real hardware, enabling smooth/precise analog input.</p> </li> <li> <p>NegCon Twist Deadzone [beetle_psx_negcon_deadzone] (0%/5%/10%/15%/20%/25%/30%)</p> <p>Sets the deadzone of the RetroPad left analog stick when simulating the 'twist' action of emulated neGcon Controllers. Used to eliminate drift/unwanted input.</p> <p>Attention</p> <p>Most (all?) negCon compatible titles provide in-game options for setting a 'twist' deadzone value. To avoid loss of precision, the in-game deadzone should always be set to zero. Any analog stick drift should instead be accounted for by configuring the 'NegCon Twist Deadzone' core option. This is particularly important when 'NegCon Twist Response' is set to 'quadratic' or 'cubic'.</p> <p>Xbox gamepads typically require a deadzone of 15-20%. Many Android-compatible bluetooth gamepads have an internal 'hardware' deadzone, allowing the deadzone value here to be set to 0%.</p> <p>For convenience, it is recommended to make use of the 'Options \u2192 Analog Setting 1P' menu of Gran Turismo when calibrating the 'NegCon Twist Deadzone'. This provides a clear and precise representation of 'real' controller input values.</p> </li> </ul>"},{"location":"library/beetle_psx/#user-1-8-device-types","title":"User 1 - 8 device types","text":"<p>The Beetle PSX core supports the following device type(s) in the controls menu, bolded device types are the default for the specified user(s):</p> <ul> <li>None - Input disabled.</li> <li>PlayStation Controller - Joypad - PlayStation Controller (SCPH-1080)</li> <li>DualShock - Joypad - DualShock (SCPH-1200)</li> <li>Analog Controller - Joypad - PlayStation Dual Analog Controller(SCPH-1180)</li> <li>Analog Joystick - Joypad - PlayStation Analog Joystick (SCPH-1110)</li> <li>Guncon / G-Con 45 - Lightgun - Namco Gun Controller (SLEH-00007)</li> <li>Justifier - Lightgun -  Konami Justifier lightgun peripheral (SLEH-00005, SLUH-00017)</li> <li>Mouse - Mouse - PlayStation Mouse (SCPH-1090, SCPH-1030)</li> <li>neGcon - Joypad - Namco third party controller</li> </ul>"},{"location":"library/beetle_psx/#rumble-support","title":"Rumble support","text":"<p>Rumble only works in the Beetle PSX core when</p> <ul> <li>The content being ran has rumble support.</li> <li>The frontend being used has rumble support.</li> <li>The joypad device being used has rumble support.</li> <li>The corresponding user's device type is set to DualShock</li> </ul>"},{"location":"library/beetle_psx/#multitap-support","title":"Multitap support","text":"<p>Activating multitap support in compatible games can be configured by the 'Port 1: Multitap enable' and 'Port 2: Multitap enable' core options.</p>"},{"location":"library/beetle_psx/#joypad","title":"Joypad","text":"User 1 - 8 input descriptors RetroPad Inputs PlayStation Controller Inputs DualShock Inputs Analog Controller Inputs Analog Joystick Inputs neGcon Inputs Cross Analog button I Square Analog button II Select Start Start D-Pad Up D-Pad Up D-Pad Down D-Pad Down D-Pad Left D-Pad Left D-Pad Right D-Pad Right Circle A Triangle B L1 Left shoulder button (analog) R1 Right shoulder button (digital) L2 Analog button II R2 Analog button I L3 R3 Left Analog X  X Left Joystick X Twist Left Analog Y  Y Left Joystick Y Right Analog X  X Right Joystick X Right Analog Y  Y Right Joystick Y"},{"location":"library/beetle_psx/#mouse","title":"Mouse","text":"RetroMouse Inputs Mouse Inputs  Mouse Cursor Mouse Cursor  Mouse 1 Mouse Left Button  Mouse 2 Mouse Right Button"},{"location":"library/beetle_psx/#lightgun","title":"Lightgun","text":"RetroLightgun Inputs Guncon / G-Con 45 Inputs Justifier Inputs  Gun Crosshair Guncon / G-Con 45 Crosshair Justifier Crosshair Gun Trigger Guncon / G-Con 45 Trigger Justifier Trigger Gun Reload Guncon / G-Con 45 Reload Justifier Reload Gun Aux A Guncon / G-Con 45 A Justifier Aux Gun Aux B Guncon / G-Con 45 B Gun Start Justifier Start"},{"location":"library/beetle_psx/#compatibility","title":"Compatibility","text":"<p>A list of known emulation bugs can be found here https://forum.fobby.net/index.php?t=msg&amp;th=1114&amp;start=0&amp;</p>"},{"location":"library/beetle_psx/#external-links","title":"External Links","text":"<ul> <li>Official Mednafen Website</li> <li>Official Mednafen Downloads</li> <li>Beetle PSX Libretro Core info file</li> <li>Beetle PSX Libretro Github Repository</li> <li>Report Beetle PSX Core Issues Here</li> <li>Gameplay Videos</li> </ul>"},{"location":"library/beetle_psx/#libretro-psx-cores","title":"Libretro PSX cores","text":"<ul> <li>PlayStation (Beetle PSX HW)</li> <li>PlayStation (PCSX ReARMed)</li> </ul>"},{"location":"library/beetle_psx_hw/","title":"PlayStation (Beetle PSX HW)","text":""},{"location":"library/beetle_psx_hw/#background","title":"Background","text":"<p>Beetle PSX HW is a port/fork of Mednafen's PSX module to the libretro API.

For best results, rotate the sticks at max amplitude for the algorithm to get a good estimate of the scaling factor, otherwise it will adjust while playing.</p> <p>While modern analog sticks have circular logical ranges, older analog sticks such as those on the DualShock have logical ranges closer to squares and can report larger values at the intercardinal directions than modern analog sticks can. Games that expect these larger values will have issues controlling with modern analog sticks, which this option can solve by scaling modern analog stick values up.</p> </li> <li> <p>Enable DualShock Analog Mode Toggle [beetle_psx_hw_analog_toggle] (disabled/enabled)</p> <p>When the input device type is set to DualShock, this option determines whether or not the Analog Button on that device can be toggled.</p> <p>When this option is disabled, the DualShock input device will be locked in Analog Mode where the analog sticks are on.</p> <p>When this option is enabled, the DualShock input device can be toggled between Digital Mode (analog sticks off) and Analog Mode (analog sticks on) much like real hardware by pressing and holding START+SELECT+L1+L2+R1+R2 for one second in lieu of a dedicated Analog Button.</p> <p>Note: Some games may not respond to input when the DualShock is in Analog Mode.

This allows for greater precision when making small movements with the analog stick.</p> <p>'cubic': Analog stick displacement is mapped cubically to negCon rotation angle. This allows for even greater precision when making small movements with the analog stick, but 'exaggerates' larger movements.</p> <p>Attention</p> <p>A linear response is not recommended when using standard gamepad devices. The negCon 'twist' mechanism is substantially different from conventional analog sticks; linear mapping over-amplifies small displacements of the stick, impairing fine control. A linear response is only appropriate when using racing wheel peripherals.</p> <p>In most cases, the 'quadratic' option should be selected. This provides effective compensation for the physical differences between real/emulated hardware and is the closest approximation of real hardware, enabling smooth/precise analog input.</p> </li> <li> <p>NegCon Twist Deadzone [beetle_psx_hw_negcon_deadzone] (0%/5%/10%/15%/20%/25%/30%)</p> <p>Sets the deadzone of the RetroPad left analog stick when simulating the 'twist' action of emulated neGcon Controllers. Used to eliminate drift/unwanted input.</p> <p>Attention</p> <p>Most (all?) negCon compatible titles provide in-game options for setting a 'twist' deadzone value. To avoid loss of precision, the in-game deadzone should always be set to zero. Any analog stick drift should instead be accounted for by configuring the 'NegCon Twist Deadzone' core option. This is particularly important when 'NegCon Twist Response' is set to 'quadratic' or 'cubic'.</p> <p>Xbox gamepads typically require a deadzone of 15-20%. Many Android-compatible bluetooth gamepads have an internal 'hardware' deadzone, allowing the deadzone value here to be set to 0%.</p> <p>For convenience, it is recommended to make use of the 'Options \u2192 Analog Setting 1P' menu of Gran Turismo when calibrating the 'NegCon Twist Deadzone'. This provides a clear and precise representation of 'real' controller input values.</p> </li> </ul>"},{"location":"library/beetle_psx_hw/#user-1-8-device-types","title":"User 1 - 8 device types","text":"<p>The Beetle PSX HW core supports the following device type(s) in the controls menu, bolded device types are the default for the specified user(s):</p> <ul> <li>None - Input disabled.</li> <li>PlayStation Controller - Joypad - PlayStation Controller (SCPH-1080)</li> <li>DualShock - Joypad - DualShock (SCPH-1200)</li> <li>Analog Controller - Joypad - PlayStation Dual Analog Controller(SCPH-1180)</li> <li>Analog Joystick - Joypad - PlayStation Analog Joystick (SCPH-1110)</li> <li>Guncon / G-Con 45 - Lightgun - Namco Gun Controller (SLEH-00007)</li> <li>Justifier - Lightgun -  Konami Justifier lightgun peripheral (SLEH-00005, SLUH-00017)</li> <li>Mouse - Mouse - PlayStation Mouse (SCPH-1090, SCPH-1030)</li> <li>neGcon - Joypad - Namco third party controller</li> </ul>"},{"location":"library/beetle_psx_hw/#rumble-support","title":"Rumble support","text":"<p>Rumble only works in the Beetle PSX HW core when</p> <ul> <li>The content being ran has rumble support.</li> <li>The frontend being used has rumble support.</li> <li>The joypad device being used has rumble support.</li> <li>The corresponding user's device type is set to DualShock</li> </ul>"},{"location":"library/beetle_psx_hw/#multitap-support","title":"Multitap support","text":"<p>'Port 1: Multitap enable' and 'Port 2: Multitap enable' core options.</p>"},{"location":"library/beetle_psx_hw/#joypad","title":"Joypad","text":"User 1 - 8 input descriptors RetroPad Inputs PlayStation Controller Inputs DualShock Inputs Analog Controller Inputs Analog Joystick Inputs neGcon Inputs Cross Analog button I Square Analog button II Select Start Start D-Pad Up D-Pad Up D-Pad Down D-Pad Down D-Pad Left D-Pad Left D-Pad Right D-Pad Right Circle A Triangle B L1 Left shoulder button (analog) R1 Right shoulder button (digital) L2 Analog button II R2 Analog button I L3 R3 Left Analog X  X Left Joystick X Twist Left Analog Y  Y Left Joystick Y Right Analog X  X Right Joystick X Right Analog Y  Y Right Joystick Y"},{"location":"library/beetle_psx_hw/#mouse","title":"Mouse","text":"RetroMouse Inputs Mouse Inputs  Mouse Cursor Mouse Cursor  Mouse 1 Mouse Left Button  Mouse 2 Mouse Right Button"},{"location":"library/beetle_psx_hw/#lightgun","title":"Lightgun","text":"RetroLightgun Inputs Guncon / G-Con 45 Inputs Justifier Inputs  Gun Crosshair Guncon / G-Con 45 Crosshair Justifier Crosshair Gun Trigger Guncon / G-Con 45 Trigger Justifier Trigger Gun Reload Guncon / G-Con 45 Reload Justifier Reload Gun Aux A Guncon / G-Con 45 A Justifier Aux Gun Aux B Guncon / G-Con 45 B Gun Start Justifier Start"},{"location":"library/beetle_psx_hw/#compatibility","title":"Compatibility","text":"<p>Expect bugs with hardware renderer enhancements.</p> <p>When using the run-ahead latency reduction feature, the \"second instance\" setting will break the hardware renderer.</p> <p>Hardware renderer currently has a number of issues with interlacing shaders and outputting on CRTs.

Games developed for it also rarely made any attempt to cap their frame rate due to the slow hardware of the time hence the need to artificially slow the CPU down on modern emulators.</p> <p>In the early 90s, Andreas Gustafsson created a port for the HP48 calculator which was eventually superseded by S-CHIP 1.0/1.1 created by Erik Bryntse. The S-CHIP added several features as well as accidentally (or intentionally?) modifying the behavior of several original opcodes:</p> <ul> <li>9 new opcodes</li> <li>128x64 HI-RES display</li> <li>Persistent storage</li> <li>Modified Bnnn, Fx55, Fx65, Dxyn, 8xy6, and 8xyE instructions</li> </ul> <p>With time, it seems the S-CHIP became more popular and many programs were written to work with its various quirks. Thus, JAXE defaults to original S-CHIP design however many of its quirks can be toggled for improved compatibility using the flags in the Options section below.</p> <p>However, recently John Earnest designed the XO-CHIP extension allowing CHIP-8 programs to take advantage of modern hardware to an extent. This extension adds several more instructions and features including:</p> <ul> <li>7 new opcodes</li> <li>16-bit addressing for a total of ~64kb RAM</li> <li>Second display buffer allowing for 4 colors instead of the typical 2</li> <li>Improved sound support</li> <li>Modified Fx75 and Fx85 instructions to allow for 16 user flags instead of typical 8</li> <li>JAXE currently supports all of these extensions.</li> </ul> <p>It should also be noted that JAXE stores its fonts in memory starting at address 0x0000 followed immediately by large fonts and finally immediately by the stack. Therefore the stack pointer initially points to address 0x00F0.</p>"},{"location":"library/jaxe/#extensions","title":"Extensions","text":"<p>Content that can be loaded by the JAXE core have the following file extensions:</p> <ul> <li>.ch8</li> <li>.sc8</li> <li>.xo8</li> </ul>"},{"location":"library/jaxe/#databases","title":"Databases","text":"<p>RetroArch database(s) that are associated with the JAXE core:</p> <ul> <li>CHIP-8</li> </ul>"},{"location":"library/jaxe/#bios","title":"BIOS","text":"<p>JAXE does not require BIOS (bootrom) files to work.</p>"},{"location":"library/jaxe/#features","title":"Features","text":"Feature Supported Restart \u2714 Screenshots \u2714 Saves \u2714 States \u2714 Rewind \u2714 Netplay \u2715 Core Options \u2714 Memory Monitoring (achievements) \u2715 RetroArch Cheats \u2714 Native Cheats \u2715 Controls \u2714 Remapping \u2714 Multi-Mouse \u2715 Rumble \u2714 Sensors \u2715 Camera \u2715 Location \u2715 Subsystem \u2715 Softpatching \u2714 Disk Control \u2715 Username \u2715 Crop Overscan (in RetroArch's Video settings) \u2715"},{"location":"library/jaxe/#directories","title":"Directories","text":"<p>The JAXE core's directory name is 'JAXE'</p>"},{"location":"library/jaxe/#core-provided-aspect-ratio","title":"Core provided aspect ratio","text":"<p>JAXE's core provided aspect ratio is 2/1.</p>"},{"location":"library/jaxe/#core-options","title":"Core options","text":"<p>The JAXE core has the following option(s) that can be tweaked from the core options menu.

You'll know when games use local Wi-Fi if the game mentions \"Wi-Fi\" and \"players nearby\", while games using WFC mention \"players around the world\" and use friend codes. The Nintendo DS local Wi-Fi does not use friend codes. This page only explains local Wi-Fi multiplayer.</p> <p>Now, the Nintendo DS local Wi-Fi isn't the normal Wi-Fi in your house, it is a mesh network that uses specialized hardware. This means that games expect extremely low latency, which is achievable between two consoles directly connected with special hardware, but harder to achieve with two computers with a router in-between, and simply impossible to achieve through the Internet. LAN multiplayer does not work through the Internet and neither with VPNs or tunnels such as Hamachi. This is not something that can be fixed easily. The only way to use emulated LAN Multiplayer is on an actual, low latency, wired LAN connection.</p> <p>The latency requirements are so extreme that even in LAN, you might still have issues. That is why using Wi-Fi in your LAN connection is not recommended, Wi-Fi simply adds too much latency, and the connection will drop frequently. The recommended way to use the emulated Wi-Fi LAN connection is with a wired LAN connection between the computers.</p>"},{"location":"library/melonds_ds/#what-is-a-mac-address","title":"What is a MAC address?","text":"<p>Every Nintendo DS (and every device capable of Wi-Fi) comes with an identifier built-in in its firmware called a \"MAC address\". For three or more Nintendo DS consoles to connect in a local Wi-Fi multiplayer network, all three need to have different MAC addresses. You can see the emulated console's MAC address in a game with Nintendo WFC by going to \"Nintendo WFC Settings\", \"Options\", \"System Information\".</p> <p>Some games will refuse to load save files that were created on a console with a different MAC address than the console loading the file. That is why it is important to pay attention to your MAC address when sharing save files across devices.</p> <p>So how does the emulated console obtain a MAC address? It depends on the core option \"MAC address mode\", in the \"Network\" category:</p> <ul> <li> <p>Set from firmware: The default setting. The emulator will use the firmware file's MAC address for the emulated console. If there is no firmware file, then a default MAC address of \"00-09-BF-11-22-33\" will be used. This setting will cause issues on LAN multiplayer with more than 2 players if the same firmware (or the default firmware) is used on more than one device.</p> </li> <li> <p>Derive from libretro username: The emulator will use your username as set on the libretro frontend to automatically generate a MAC address. Such generated MAC addresses will start with \"00-08-BF\". Devices with the same username set will always generate the same MAC address. Useful when syncing save files across devices to guarantee the emulated console's MAC address is the same on all devices. This setting will cause issues on LAN multiplayer if more than one player has the same username. The username can be set on RetroArch by going to \"Settings\", \"User\", \"Username\".</p> </li> </ul>"},{"location":"library/melonds_ds/#starting-a-multiplayer-session-retroarch","title":"Starting a multiplayer session (RetroArch)","text":"<p>Before starting a multiplayer session, it is recommended that all set a proper username in \"Settings\", \"User\", \"Username\", in RetroArch, and set the MAC address mode to \"Derive from libretro username\".</p> <p>In RetroArch, such a multiplayer session can be started through the \"Netplay\" menu either before starting a game or during a game. One player should host and the others should use the \"Refresh Netplay LAN List\" option to join. In game, you'd look for something mentioning local multiplayer and \"players nearby\". In Pok\u00e9mon games, this can be accessed on the top floor of Pok\u00e9mon centers, in Mario Kart DS, it is the \"Multiplayer\" option in the menu etc. There are a ton of pages online saying that \"Netplay is not network emulation\". For various reasons, these pages are wrong when it comes to melonDS DS.</p> <p>Again, emulated LAN multiplayer only works if all players are on the same real local network.

On a CRT TV, a few pixels on each side of the screen are usually hidden. Most SNES games output 224 scanlines, while others use the SNES\u2019 239 scanlines mode. To avoid the window or picture size changing when the game changes between either mode, Mesen-S always outputs 239 scanlines. In the vast majority of games, this results in 7 blank lines on the top and 8 on the bottom. To hide these blank scanlines, set the overscan value to 8.</p> </li> <li> <p>Horizontal Overscan [mesen-s_overscan_horizontal] (None/8px/16px)</p> <p>This overscan setting allow you to cut out pixels horizontally on the edge of the screen.</p> </li> <li> <p>Aspect Ratio [mesen-s_aspect_ratio] (Auto/No Stretching/NTSC/PAL/4:3/16:9)</p> <p>The SNES\u2019 resolution in most games is 256x224, but it used to be displayed on CRT TVs that had a rectangular picture. To simulate a CRT TV, you can use the Auto option - it will switch between NTSC and PAL aspect ratios depending on the game you are playing.

However, this mode causes horizontal blending, which is sometimes used for pseudo-transparency effects.

Look at the HD packs section for more information.</p> </li> <li> <p>Remove sprite limit [mesen_nospritelimit] (Off/On)</p> <p>The NES can normally only draw up to 8 sprites per line \u2013 this limitation is indirectly responsible for some of the flickering seen in games at times. When this option is enabled, the limit is disabled, allowing up to 64 sprites to be drawn on the same line.</p> </li> <li> <p>Enable fake stereo effect [mesen_fake_stereo] (Off/On)</p> <p>Self-explanatory.</p> </li> <li> <p>Reduce popping on Triangle channel [mesen_mute_triangle_ultrasonic] (Off/On)</p> <p>This option mutes the triangle channel under certain conditions, which prevents it from causing popping sounds.</p> </li> <li> <p>Reduce popping on DMC channel [mesen_reduce_dmc_popping] (Off/On)</p> <p>Similar to the previous option, but for the DMC channel \u2013 this option prevents games from changing the output of the DMC channel too abruptly, which often causes popping sounds.</p> </li> <li> <p>Swap Square channel duty cycles [mesen_swap_duty_cycle] (Off/On)</p> <p>This option is to mimic some older NES clones that had incorrect sound output for both of the square channels. It greatly alters the sound in some games, and shouldn\u2019t be enabled unless you want this behavior.</p> </li> <li> <p>Disable Noise channel mode flag [mesen_disable_noise_mode_flag] (Off/On)</p> <p>Very early Famicom models did not implement this feature, so this option is available to mimic early Famicom consoles. It changes the sound output of the noise channel in some games, and shouldn\u2019t be enabled unless you want this behavior.</p> </li> <li> <p>Screen Rotation [mesen_screenrotation] (None/90 degrees/180 degrees/270 degrees)</p> <p>Rotates the display by the specified angle. This is useful to play games (generally homebrew games) designed for a vertical display.</p> </li> <li> <p>Default power-on state for RAM [mesen_ramstate] (All 0s (Default)/All 1s/Random Values)</p> <p>On a console, the RAM\u2019s state at power on is undetermined and relatively random. This option lets you select Mesen\u2019s behavior when initializing RAM - set all bits to 0, set all bits to 1, or randomize the value of each bit.</p> </li> <li> <p>FDS: Automatically insert disks [mesen_fdsautoinsertdisk] (Off/On)</p> <p>By default, the FDS boots with no disk inserted in the drive. This option makes it so the player does not need to manually insert disk 1, side A manually.</p> </li> <li> <p>FDS: Fast forward while loading [mesen_fdsfastforwardload] (Off/On)</p> <p>FDS games contain a large number of load screens due to their data being stored on floppy drives. Mesen needs to emulate this floppy drive\u2019s speed to ensure accurate emulation. This option makes it so Mesen runs the emulation as fast as it can when a game is loading data from the disk, which greatly reduces the time spent on loading screens.</p> </li> </ul>"},{"location":"library/mesen/#controllers","title":"Controllers","text":"<p>The Mesen core supports the following device type(s) in the controls menu, bolded device types are the default for the specified user(s):</p>"},{"location":"library/mesen/#user-1-2-device-types","title":"User 1 - 2 device types","text":"<ul> <li>None - Input disabled.</li> <li>Auto - Joypad - Automatically selects an input device according to the data in the game database.</li> <li>Standard Controller - Joypad - Manually selects a standard game controller.</li> <li>Zapper - Pointer - Manually selects a Zapper light gun.</li> <li>Power Pad - Joypad - Manually selects a Power Pad peripheral.</li> <li>Arkanoid - Mouse - Manually selects an Arkanoid controller.</li> <li>SNES Controller - Joypad - Manually selects a SNES Controller.</li> <li>SNES Mouse - Mouse - Manually selects a SNES Mouse.</li> </ul>"},{"location":"library/mesen/#user-3-device-types","title":"User 3 device types","text":"<ul> <li>None - Input disabled.</li> <li>Auto - Joypad - Automatically selects an input device according to the data in the game database.</li> <li>Standard Controller - Joypad - Manually selects a standard game controller.</li> </ul>"},{"location":"library/mesen/#user-4-device-types","title":"User 4 device types","text":"<ul> <li>None - Input disabled.</li> <li>Auto - Joypad - Automatically selects an input device according to the data in the game database.</li> <li>Standard Controller - Joypad - Manually selects a standard game controller.</li> </ul>"},{"location":"library/mesen/#user-5-device-types","title":"User 5 device types","text":"<ul> <li>None - Input disabled.</li> <li>Auto - Joypad - Automatically selects an input device according to the data in the game database.</li> <li>Arkanoid - Mouse - Manually selects an Arkanoid controller.</li> <li>Ascii Turbo Fire - None - Manually selects an Ascii Turbo Fire device.</li> <li>Bandai Hypershot - Pointer - Manually selects a Bandai Hypershot light gun.</li> <li>Battle Box - None - Manually selects a Battle Box device.</li> <li>Exciting Boxing - Joypad - Manually selects an Exciting Boxing punching bag.</li> <li>Family Trainer - Joypad - Manually selects a Family Trainer peripheral.</li> <li>Four Player Adapter - None - Manually selects a Four Player Adapter device.</li> <li>Hori Track - Mouse - Manually selects a Hori Track trackball.</li> <li>Konami Hypershot - Joypad - Manually selects a Konami Hypershot controller.</li> <li>Pachinko - Joypad - Manually selects a Pachinko controller.</li> <li>Partytap - Joypad - Manually selects Partytap controllers.</li> </ul>"},{"location":"library/mesen/#other-controllers","title":"Other controllers","text":"<ul> <li>Oeka Kids Tablet - Pointer - The Mesen core will automatically select the Oeka Kids Tablet input device according to the data in the game database.

Higher values require more computational power.</p> </li> <li> <p>Aspect Ratio (4:3/16:9/16:9 adjusted)</p> <p>This setting adjusts the aspect ratio of the video output. All N64 games support 4:3. Some games support 16:9 within game settings.</p> </li> <li> <p>Bilinear filtering mode (standard/3point)</p> <p>Bilinear filtering: Textures will use standard PC-style bilinear filtering. 3 point: Textures will be filtered more like the N64. The result is less smooth but more accurate.</p> </li> <li> <p>MSAA level (0/2/4/8/16)</p> <p>Enable/Disable MultiSampling Anti-aliasing (0=off, 2,4,8,16=quality).</p> <p>This core option is not available on all platforms.</p> </li> <li> <p>Framebuffer Emulation (True/False)</p> <p>Enable the framebuffer emulation. Frame buffer emulation is a set of techniques used to emulate manipulations with color and depth buffer areas on the real console. Unchecking this option disables many effects including cropping, aspect ratio, N64 resolution factor and more. Do not uncheck this option unless you have performance issues.</p> </li> <li> <p>Color buffer to RDRAM (Async/Sync/Off)</p> <p>Used with the framebuffer emulation. Frame buffer copy is used for some effects (e.g. TV monitor effect where TV shows part of the displayed picture). In some games GLideN64 cannot detect when the game uses the frame buffer. With these options, you can have GLideN64 copy each frame of your video cards frame buffer to N64 memory. Off: Disable copying buffers from video card. Synchronous: Effects are detected for all games, but it can be slow. Use for games where Asynchronous does not work. Asynchronous: Effects are detected for most games (best choice).</p> <p>The default setting is dependent on your platform.</p> </li> <li> <p>Depth buffer to RDRAM (Software/FromMem/Off)</p> <p>Used with the framebuffer emulation. The depth buffer is used to emulate some effects (e.g. coronas). Off: Depth buffer is disabled. FromMem: Your video card\u2019s depth buffer is copied to N64 memory each frame, which can be slow on some games. Software: Generally faster than copying from VRAM, but the result can be imperfect.</p> </li> <li> <p>Hardware per-pixel lighting (False/True)</p> <p>In N64 games lighting is calculated per vertex. This option enables hardware per-pixel lighting calculation known as Phong shading, which provides smoother and more realistic lighting. Per-vertex lighting is instead calculated via software. HLE only.</p> </li> <li> <p>Continuous texrect coords (Off/Auto/Force)</p> <p>In some games the coordinates for parts of 2D elements are not aligned: there is a half-pixel split between adjacent elements. When rendering at the N64\u2019s original resolution it is not visible, but when the image is scaled up it results in black lines. This option attempts to connect these 2D elements.</p> </li> <li> <p>Native res. 2D texrects (False/True)     When checked, 2D elements are rendered at the N64s resolution before copying them to output.     This usually eliminates display issues with 2D elements, but it can be slow.     This option uses heuristics to detect adjacent 2D elements that does not work for every game.</p> </li> <li> <p>Less accurate blending mode (True/False)</p> <p>Do not use shaders to emulate N64 blending modes. Works faster on slow GPU. It can cause glitches. The default setting is dependent on your platform.</p> </li> <li> <p>GPU shader depth write (False/True)</p> <p>Enable writing of fragment depth. Some mobile GPUs do not support it, thus it made optional. The default setting is dependent on your platform.</p> </li> <li> <p>Cache GPU Shaders (True/False)</p> <p>When the option is enabled, plugin saves all new created shaders in a file. When user starts that game again, plugin loads all previously compiled shaders from that file and further gameplay goes smooth.</p> </li> <li> <p>Crop Mode (Auto/Off)</p> <p>Its purpose is to remove black borders, which many N64 games add around image. In auto mode plugins tries to detect empty space and remove it. It works only if frame buffer emulation is enabled, as all other post-processing filters.</p> </li> <li> <p>Texture filter (None/Smooth filtering 1/Smooth filtering 2/Smooth filtering 3/Smooth filtering 4/Sharp filtering 1/Sharp filtering 2)</p> <p>This filter smooths or sharpens textures. There are four smoothing filters and two sharpening filters. The higher the number, the stronger the effect. Performance may be affected depending on the game and/or your device.</p> </li> <li> <p>Texture Enhancement (None/As Is/X2/X2SAI/HQ2X/HQ2XS/LQ2X/LQ2XS/HQ4X/2xBRZ/3xBRZ/4xBRZ/5xBRZ/6xBRZ)</p> <p>Filter applied to textures. Depending on which filter, they may cause performance problems. When AS IS is selected, textures are saved to the cache as-is; this improves performance in games that load many textures; unset Filer background textures for the best performance.</p> </li> <li> <p>Filter background textures (True/False)</p> <p>This option skips texture enhancements for long, narrow textures that are usually used for backgrounds. This may save texture memory and improve performance. Set true unless Enhancement mode is set to AS IS.</p> </li> <li> <p>Use High-Res textures (False/True)</p> <p>Enable the high resolution textures. Usage of hires textures is explained above.</p> </li> <li> <p>Use High-Res Full Alpha Channel (False/True)</p> <p>When this option is selected, GlideN64 will check how the texture\u2019s alpha channel was designed and will select the most appropriate format. This gives texture pack designers freedom to use semi-transparent textures. Clear this option for older or poorly designed texture packs.

The NEC PC-9800, also known as the PC-98, were a family of computers made by NEC throughout 1982 to 2000. Despite using Intel x86 chips, MS-DOS and Windows OS, and many other superficial similarities, the series is not IBM compatible. Some PC-98 software may work on an IBM or vice versa, but this is very YMMV. In fact, the introduction of a native Japanese version of standard MS-DOS in the early 90s and subsequent entry of cheaper foreign IBM clones in the Japanese market was the nail in the coffin for the PC-98.

To avoid loss of precision, the in-game deadzone should always be set to zero. Any analog stick drift should instead be accounted for by configuring the 'NegCon Twist Deadzone' core option. This is particularly important when 'NegCon Twist Response' is set to 'quadratic' or 'cubic'.</p> <p>Xbox gamepads typically require a deadzone of 15-20%. Many Android-compatible bluetooth gamepads have an internal 'hardware' deadzone, allowing the deadzone value here to be set to 0%.</p> <p>For convenience, it is recommended to make use of the 'Options \u2192 Analog Setting 1P' menu of Gran Turismo when calibrating the 'NegCon Twist Deadzone'.

Optimal setting for gamepads.</p> <p>'cubic': Analog stick displacement is mapped cubically to negCon rotation angle. This allows for even greater precision when making small movements with the analog stick, but 'exaggerates' larger movements. Enables precise control but difficult to use.</p> </li> </ul> <p>Attention</p> <p>A linear response is not recommended when using standard gamepad devices. The negCon 'twist' mechanism is substantially different from conventional analog sticks; linear mapping over-amplifies small displacements of the stick, impairing fine control.

The default user-settings.h file disables any features and optimizations which might cause compilation failure on AMD/ATI GPU's. Despite the name of the options, this is not a problem with your card or drivers; it's a shortcoming in the Cg shader compiler's nVidia-centric profile setups.</p> <p>Uncommenting the following #define macros at the top of user-settings.h will help performance a good deal on compatible nVidia cards:</p> <pre><code>#define DRIVERS_ALLOW_DERIVATIVES\n#define DRIVERS_ALLOW_DYNAMIC_BRANCHES\n#define ACCOMODATE_POSSIBLE_DYNAMIC_LOOPS #define DRIVERS_ALLOW_TEX2DLOD\n#define DRIVERS_ALLOW_TEX2DBIAS\n</code></pre> <p>A few of these warrant some elaboration. First, derivatives:</p> <ul> <li> <p>Derivatives allow the shader to cheaply calculate a tangent-space matrix for correct antialiasing when curvature or overscan are used. Without them, there are two options:</p> <ul> <li>Cheat, and there will be artifacts with strong cylindrical curvature</li> <li>Compute the correct tangent-space matrix analytically. This is used by default, and it's controlled by this option near the bottom: geom_force_correct_tangent_matrix = true</li> </ul> </li> <li> <p>Dynamic branches:</p> </li> </ul> <p>Dynamic branches allow the shader to avoid performing computations that it doesn't need (but might have, given different runtime options). Without them, the shader has to either let the GPU evaluate every possible codepath and select a result, or make a \"best guess\" ahead of time. The full phosphor bloom suffers most from not having dynamic branches, because the shader doesn't know how big of a blur to use until it knows your phosphor mask dot pitch...which you set at runtime if shader parameters are enabled.</p> <p>If RUNTIME_PHOSPHOR_BLOOM_SIGMA is commented out (faster), this won't matter: The shader will just select the blur size and standard deviation suitable for the mask_triad_size_desired_static setting in user-settings.cgp. It will be fast, but larger triads won't blur enough, and smaller triads will blur more than they need to. However, if RUNTIME_PHOSPHOR_BLOOM_SIGMA is enabled, the shader will calculate an optimal standard deviation and try to use the right blur size for it...but using an \"if standard deviation is such and such\" condition would be prohibitively slow without dynamic branches. Instead, the shader uses the largest and slowest blur the user lets it use (to cover the widest range of triad sizes and standard deviations), according to these macros:</p> <pre><code>#define PHOSPHOR_BLOOM_TRIADS_LARGER_THAN_3_PIXELS\n//#define PHOSPHOR_BLOOM_TRIADS_LARGER_THAN_6_PIXELS\n//#define PHOSPHOR_BLOOM_TRIADS_LARGER_THAN_9_PIXELS\n//#define PHOSPHOR_BLOOM_TRIADS_LARGER_THAN_12_PIXELS\n</code></pre> <p>The more you have uncommented, the larger the triads you can blur, but the slower runtime sigmas will be if your GPU can't use dynamic branches. By default, triads up to 6 pixels wide will be bloomed perfectly, and a little beyond that (8 should be fine), but going too far beyond that will create blocking artifacts in the blur due to an insufficient support size.</p> <ul> <li>tex2Dlod:</li> </ul> <p>The tex2Dlod function allows the shader to disables anisotropic filtering, which can get confused when we're manually tiling the texture coordinates for a small resized phosphor mask tile (it creates nasty seam artifacts). There are several ways the shader can deal with this: The cheapest is to use tex2Dlod to tile the output of MASK_RESIZE across the screen...and the slower alternatives either require derivatives or force the shader to draw 2 tiles to MASK_RESIZE in each direction, thereby reducing your maximum allowed dot pitch by half.</p> <ul> <li>tex2Dbias:</li> </ul> <p>According to nVidia's Cg language standard library page, tex2Dbias requires the fp30 profile, which doesn't work on ATI/AMD cards...but you might actually have mixed results. This can be used as a substitute for tex2Dlod at times, so it's worth trying even on ATI.</p>"},{"location":"shader/crt_royale/#why-is-everything-still-so-slow","title":"#Why is everything still so slow?!?","text":"<p>For maximum quality and configurability out of the box, almost all shader parameters are enabled by default (except for the disproportionately expensive runtime subpixel offsets).

Don't hesitate to download from these sources as they are verified by the RetroArch community.</p> <p>Example</p> WindowsAndroid <p>Store:</p> <ul> <li>Steam</li> <li>Itch.io</li> </ul> <p>Main:</p> <ul> <li>Buildbot</li> </ul> <p>Store:</p> <ul> <li>Google Play</li> <li>Amazon</li> </ul> <p>Main:</p> <ul> <li>Buildbot</li> </ul> <p>As you can see here, Google Play installation and distribution was made by LibRetro, while Amazon was done by Gadsby.

We report these situations and external uploads made on the link that we did not report or share do not belong to us.</p> <p>Now that we've talked about our download sources, we can come to the download stages.

This applies for most platforms. These options are divided into two as Stable and Nightly. Let's get to know these options closely:</p> StableNightly <p>The stable version is our first priority and the main distribution version. Since it is the major release, it comes out periodically. Stable releases take more time to manufacture, but new features become available in the next version. For example: A version can have a new theme and feature, and in the next version, this theme and feature can be removed, improved or changed. As can be understood from the name of Stable, this version is more stable because it is controlled accordingly to make it work better on the platform it is suitable for.</p> <p>This version contains the latest commits available on GitHub, and the latest enhancements and features are added daily. This version may not be as stable as Stable version because it is build daily, but this does not mean that it is not stable.</p> <p>So how do you decide which of these options is right for you?

The simplicity of it all requires some explanation in order to truly grasp how useful it can be to your own projects.</p> <p>While the libretro API is simple in nature, it is also incredibly powerful. By using the libretro API, your program becomes a single library file, known as a 'libretro core', that can be loaded by any frontend that supports the libretro API. </p> <p>The beauty of this approach is that the frontend is responsible for providing all the implementation-specific details, such as video/audio/input drivers. This means that as a developer, you don't have to worry about writing different video drivers for Direct3D or OpenGL, or supporting all known joypads or input/sound APIs. All of these details are handled by the frontend, which frees up your time and energy to focus solely on creating the main program.</p> <p>Additionally, the libretro API allows for cross-platform compatibility, meaning that a libretro core can be used on multiple platforms with minimal effort. This makes it an ideal choice for developers who want to create games or emulators that can be easily ported to different platforms.</p> <p>In summary, the libretro API offers a simple yet powerful way to create games and emulators.
