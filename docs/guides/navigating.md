# Navigating

Navigating on RetroArch is as easy as you can imagine. Depending on the device you have, the control scheme is determined automatically. For example, if you are going to use it on a computer, the basic key combinations of the keyboard will apply. You move with the arrow keys and select with the Enter key, and you return with the Backspace key. If you plug a controller, you can also move with the D-Pad keys.

## PC

By default the keyboard should be ready to use.

Using the *left* and *right* arrow keys, you move to a different tab, each tab will relate to an aspect of the RetroArch experience (main menu for game loading, settings for settings etc.). Once the desired tab is selected, use the *up* and *down* arrow to move to an option.

To advance in the menu press *Enter* (or *Return*). To go back to the previous menu push *Backspace*.

Whilst in a game use the *F1* key [MOVE TO ANOTHER PAGE]

Pushing *Esc* twice will quit the program

### Main Menu

### Image, Music and Video

These tabs will handle all your media. Images will contain any screenshots you've made.

### Netplay

RetroArch relies on peer-to-peer networking to reduce network latency and ensure the best possible experience. Allows multi-player over the internet. Host or join a network gaming session. Rediscover the joy of multiplayer games using RetroArch's builtin netplay lobby. You can also use the spectator mode to watch others play.

### Import content

Either you scan automatically so that your content that matches the last database will add to the playlists or you scan manually without being dependent on the database so you can freely add your contents to playlists.

## Mobile

The mobile interface is much more minimalistic compared to the PC's interface. Touch is the default input, although depending on device other options may be available. There are three different tabs, which can be switched at the bottom of the menu.
