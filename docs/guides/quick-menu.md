# Quick Menu

The **Quick Menu** is effectively RetroArch's pause menu.

## Controls
The Quick Menu can be accessed by pressing a certain gamepad combination, pressing the `F1` key on your keyboard, or tapping on the "[Invader](../start/understanding/#logomascot)" or "Menu" button on most Gamepad Overlays.

The RetroPad button combination for opening the Quick Menu can be changed at `Settings>Input> Hotkeys> Menu Toggle`. Users select the combination from a list (Custom combinations cannot the applied):

* None
* Done + Y + L1 + R1
* L3 + R3
* L1 + R1 + Start + Select
* Start + Select
* L3 + R1
* L1 + R1
* Hold Start (2 seconds)
* Hold Select (2 seconds)
* Down + Select
* L2 + R2


## Features ##

The Quick Menu provides access to many core-specific settings and options while the content is paused in the background. Options include (but are not limited to) adjusting the video resolution and system region, remapping controller inputs, managing Load/Save States, cheats or shaders, and taking screenshots or recording video clips.

### Close Content
The most important function exclusive to the Quick Menu (aside from `Resume Content`) is `Close Content`. This safely 'shuts off' the emulated system and its content, returning the user to RetroArch's main menu without having to quit RetroArch completely.

### Disc Control
Another "exclusive" function that appears with certain cores is swapping discs using the `Disc Control` option: See [Disc Swapping](./disc-swapping).
