Or you can go to the Google Play Store page by clicking here for [64bit](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.retroarch.aarch64&hl=en_US "RetroArch64") or by clicking here for [32bit](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.retroarch&hl=en "RetroArch").

>Go to `Settings` - `System` and check `Kernel version`. If the code inside contains **x64** string, your device has a `64-bit OS`; if you cannot find this string, then is **32-bit**.
4. Click on the downloaded APK file.
