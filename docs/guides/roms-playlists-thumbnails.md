# ROMs, Playlists, and Thumbnails

## Storing games and other content
Game ROMs should be placed within the `roms` folder as configured in RetroArch. Many users sort their ROMs into subfolders named after the system which the ROMs belong to, which results in a folder arrangement such as:


     roms/
          Atari - 2600/
               Atari Game 1.zip
               Atari Game 2.zip
               Atari Game 3.zip
          Nintendo - Nintendo Entertainment System/
               NES Game 1.zip
          Sega - 32X/
               32X Game 1.zip
               32X Game 2.zip
          etc.
          etc.

This arrangement is not required and you are free to organize your ROMs as you prefer.

## Working with Playlists
Playlists (or Collections as they are sometimes referred to) are the lists of games and other content that can be generated automatically by the RetroArch playlist scanner, generated by a third-party playlist utility or script, or edited by hand in a text editor.

### RetroArch Playlist Scanner

RetroArch incorporates a ROM scanning system to automatically produce playlists. Each ROM that is scanned by the playlist generator is checked against a database of ROMs that are known to be good copies.

In order for content to be correctly scanned, you must:

  - Have a compatible core already downloaded and installed
  - Update `Core Info Files` via `Online Updater`
  - Update `Databases` via `Online Updater`
  - Restart RetroArch if any of the above was just done

Finally, the content must match existing databases from the [libretro-database README](#sources). If those conditions are met but content is still not being added automatically to a playlist, consider submitting an issue report on [github](https://www.github.com/libretro/RetroArch/issues).

#### Designating which core to use

RetroArch will attempt to detect and use the correct core for use with the ROMs that are used as part of a playlist. Under some circumstances, it may be useful to manually set a particular core for one of its playlists. This can be accomplished within the Playlists submenu in the RetroArch settings.

### Playlist File Overview

Each playlist is a plain text file with an extension of `.lpl`. RetroArch 1.7.5 and later uses a JSON playlist format, although the backwards compatibility remains for the deprecated "6-Line" playlist format.

**Note:** The paths in playlist files need to use the correct 'slash' character for the user's platform. Linux, OS X, and Android systems including Lakka and LudOS require forward slashes `/`, while Windows and DOS systems require backslashes `\`.

!!! Hint "Hint for Windows Users"
    The built-in Notepad editor cannot work with cross-platform text files such as RetroArch playlist files. Many users and developers recommend the free [Notepad++](https://notepad-plus-plus.org/) as a replacement although most alternative text editors will also work.

#### JSON Playlist Format

The following example is a single-entry MAME 2003-Plus playlist for [Alien Arena](https://www.arcade-museum.com/game_detail.php?game_id=6850) -- the silent version of this game is available through the RetroArch **Content Downloader** found in the **Online Updater** menu.

The playlist is named `MAME 2003-Plus.lpl` which means it will match the existing icon for that core's playlists in the RetroArch assets pack and display it for the playlist for menu drivers that implement playlist icons.

The **Alien Arena** romset is located at `C:\retroarch\downloads\alienar.zip`; note that the backslashes are doubled in JSON-formatted playlist entries so that the value of the `path` entry is `C:\\retroarch\\downloads\\alienar.zip`.

##### `MAME 2003-Plus.lpl`
```json
{
  "version": "1.0",
  "items": [
    {
      "path": "C:\\retroarch\\downloads\\alienar.zip",
      "label": "Alien Arena",
      "core_path": "DETECT",
      "core_name": "DETECT",
      "crc32": "01ACE2AB|crc",
      "db_name": "MAME 2003-Plus.lpl"
    }
  ]
}
```

!!! Alert
    You can omit the CRC or Serial for a manually created playlist entry by using the word `DETECT`  instead, although it may limit your ability to use netplay for this playlist entry.

#### 6-Line Playlist Format (Deprecated)

!!! Warning
    This playlist format is deprecated and may not always be supported by RetroArch in the future. New playlists should be created in the JSON format.

**Each entry in a playlist must be composed of 6 lines:**

##### `MAME 2003-Plus.lpl`
```
C:\retroarch\downloads\alienar.zip"
Alien Arena
/tmp/cores/mame2003_plus_libretro.so
DETECT
01ACE2AB|crc
MAME 2003-Plus.lpl
```

1. The path to the ROM. This can either be an 'absolute' path or a path relative to the current working directory.
2. The display name (you can use any name here)
3. The path to the core, this libretro core will be used to launch the ROM. **You can use the word DETECT in place of the core path here. Once this is done you can set the core to be used for this playlist via the RetroArch GUI.**
4. The displayname of the core, not really useful, we keep it there because the history list is also using this format
5. CRC or Serial number for database and other matching purposes. **You can omit the CRC or Serial for a manually created playlist entry by using the word DETECT here instead, although it may limit your ability to use Netplay for this playlist entry.**
6. The name of this playlist, ending in the extension .lpl

### Third-Party Applications

Since playlists are managed in text-only JSON format, there are a few third-party applications to help manage your playlists.

## Thumbnails

RetroArch can display three types of thumbnails for games in playlists, depending on the specific RetroArch menu driver in use:

* In-game snapshots
* Title screen snapshots
* Boxart

### RetroArch thumbnail packs
RetroArch provides packs of thumbnails suitable for use with many emulated systems. These thumbnail packs are recommended for most users and can be installed connecting to the internet and using the built-in thumbnails updater, available from the online update menu within the RetroArch settings interface.

These packs can be downloaded manually from http://thumbnailpacks.libretro.com and individual thumbnails from within the packs can be downloaded from http://thumbnails.libretro.com.

### Custom thumbnails
Users who wish to use their own thumbnails can do so by naming PNG image files according to the RetroArch naming convention.

#### Thumbnail paths and filenames
Thumbnails should be stored in subfolders within the configured RetroArch `thumbnails` directory within a subfolder named exactly the same as the playlist, except without `.lpl` at the end. **Example: If your playlist is named `Atari - 2600.lpl`, then your Atari 2600 root thumbnail folder should be called `thumbnails/Atari - 2600/`.**

Within this root thumbnail folder called `Atari - 2600`, you should then create subfolders named `Named_Boxarts`, `Named_Snaps`, or `Named_Titles` for boxart/cover art, in-game snapshots, and title screens, respectively.

The thumbnail filename should exactly match the game's title as listed in the playlist with an important exception. **The following characters in playlist titles must be replaced with `_` in the corresponding thumbnail filename:** `` &*/:`<>?\| ``

**Example: If your content is named `Q*bert's Qubes` in the playlist, then its thumbnails should be named `Q_bert's Qubes.png` and stored at these paths:**

```
     thumbnails/
          Atari - 2600/
               Named_Boxarts/
                    Q_bert's Qubes.png
               Named_Snaps/
                    Q_bert's Qubes.png
               Named_Titles/
                    Q_bert's Qubes.png
```


### Changing the displayed thumbnail type
Regardless of whether you download the RetroArch thumbnail packs or use your own custom thumbnails, you can use the RetroArch GUI to set which type of thumbnail to display. In order to change this setting, go to `Menu Settings,` and change the `Thumbnails` option to reflect the type of thumbnail you wish to display.
