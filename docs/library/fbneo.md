# FinalBurn Neo

## Note about this document

It mostly assumes you are using RetroArch as your libretro frontend, some specific instructions might differ if you are using another frontend.

It also assumes you are already knowledgeable about arcade emulation and its quirks. If you aren't, you should be reading [getting started with arcade emulation](https://docs.libretro.com/guides/arcade-getting-started/) first.

## Background

FinalBurn Neo (also referred to as FBNeo or FBN) is a multi-system emulator (Arcade, consoles and computers) under active development.
It is the follow-up of the FinalBurn and FinalBurn Alpha emulators.
The libretro core provides wide compatibility with platforms and features supported by libretro.

## Difference from MAME

FBNeo strives for accuracy, just like MAME. There are some arcade boards where one or the other will be more accurate, but for the most part they should be equally accurate.
The main difference with MAME is that FBNeo doesn't mind including "quality of life" hacks, while MAME is mostly focused on preservation and documentation. "Quality of life" hacks include things like :

* improving original game's sound (some games like "Burger Time" have noise which was clearly unintended by their developpers, we are removing it)
* implementing alternative colors for games where the colors don't look right (sometimes there are controversies about which colors are right for an arcade board, like "Tropical Angel", we implement alternative colors as dipswitches)
* having control alternatives that didn't exist on original cabinet (play rotary stick games like twin-stick shooters, use lightguns in "Rambo 3", use simplified 8-way directional controls for "Battlezone", ...)
* improving the gaming experience by cutting what we deem as unnecessary aspect of emulation (you don't have to spend 20 minutes "installing" CPS-3 games, neither 100s loading Deco Cassette games)
* reducing hardware requirements by cutting what we deem as unnecessary corners in the emulation code
* supporting popular romhacks

Note: some of those "quality of life" hacks might be doable with programming skills and lua language on MAME

## License and changelog

It's distributed under a non-commercial license, see [LICENSE.md](https://github.com/finalburnneo/FBNeo/blob/master/LICENSE.md) and [whatsnew.html](https://github.com/finalburnneo/FBNeo/blob/master/whatsnew.html).

There are controversies about whether libretro's patreon and retroarch's GPL license breaks FBNeo's non-commercial license or not. This is what you should know :

* **"Redistributions may not be sold, nor may they be used in a commercial product or activity."** : By definition, a commercial activity is an activity involving the sale of goods or services. The libretro project does none of that, and it is unclear whether a patreon should be treated as a commercial activity or not when no goods or services are provided in exchange of the donations.
* **"You may not ask for donations to support your work on any project that uses the FB Neo source code."** : This FBNeo port is using libretro code, not the other way around. This port is directly authored/maintained/supported by members of the FBNeo team, and none of them is receiving donations. Interestingly, if receiving donations was de facto a commercial activity, this term shouldn't be required.
* *If* the libretro project was a commercial activity, it would still be unclear how it does affect this port. Our win32 standalone builds use the directx api, which belongs to a commercial company. Using the libretro api, which would belong to a commercial activity, wouldn't be any different. Furthermore, in all likeliness, there would still be alternative libretro frontends that don't belong to the libretro project and are not commercial. 
* Actually, alternative commercial libretro frontends already exist, and we consider we are not concerned as long as they neither redistribute FBNeo nor use it as some mean of advertisement. In this scenario, only a manual installation of the core by the user will be considered legal and supported.
* While GPL code can't be mixed with non-commercial code, this is a non-issue since this port doesn't contain any GPL-licensed code.
* Under european law, where the libretro buildbots are located, linking GPL and non-commercial softwares doesn't produce a derivative work, and doesn't extend the GPL license to the non-commercial work (source [here](https://joinup.ec.europa.eu/collection/eupl/licence-compatibility-permissivity-reciprocity-and-interoperability)). It is unclear whether the same applies in non-EU countries or not.

## Extensions

zip, 7z

## Building this core manually

From the root of the repository, run
```
make -j5 -C src/burner/libretro
```
Note : `-j5` is to optimize build time on cpus with 4 cores (X+1 cores), you can rise or reduce that value to match your own, however a value too high will increase ram usage and might even cause your system to become unstable.

Note : Here is a non-exhaustive list of additional parameters you might want to append to the make command line :

* **SUBSET=all** : Build a core that supports everything. This is the default SUBSET so you don't need to append it.
* **SUBSET=neogeo** : Build a core that only supports neogeo games.
* **SUBSET=cps12** : Build a core that only supports CPS-1 & CPS-2 games.
* **generate-files** : Generate header/gamelist files and stop there.
* **clean** : Remove any previously built object.
* **REGEN_HEADERS=1** : This will run **generate-files** and **clean** consecutively before building the core, which is usually required when you made a change to the list of drivers you want to build, either from modifying the project's code or switching between SUBSETs. Note that make version 4.4 may be required for this to behave properly.

## Building romsets for FBNeo

Arcade emulation won't work properly without the romsets matching the emulator. FBNeo being an emulator under active development, a given romset might change from time to time to stay in sync with the best dump available for that game.

Don't expect things to work properly if you didn't build valid romsets, and don't report issues because your romsets are invalid.

### Step 1: Obtaining an XML DAT

You can download the dat files for the latest version of the core from the [dats](https://github.com/libretro/FBNeo/tree/master/dats/) directory.

### Step 2: Gathering the ingredients

It mostly consists of latest dumps available for MAME.
The other romsets are usually a mix of hacks and homebrews, most of them can be found in HBMAME dumps.
Having an older FBAlpha/FBNeo set among your ingredients will also help a lot.

### Step 3: Building the romsets

Refer to a [clrmamepro tutorial](https://docs.libretro.com/guides/arcade-getting-started/#optional-clrmamepro-tutorial) for details on how to configure ClrMamePro to use your sources as "rebuild" folders.

## Mapping

We don't have a tool like the MAME OSD, instead we use the libretro api to announce buttons and let the frontend customize mapping, this is done through `Quick Menu > Controls`.

For those who don't want to fully customize their mapping, there are 2 convenient presets you can apply by changing the "device type" for a player in this menu :

* **Classic** : it will apply the original neogeo layout from neogeo cd gamepads for neogeo games, and use L/R as 5th and 6th button for 6 buttons games like Street Fighter II.
* **Modern** : it will apply the modern neogeo layout from neogeo arcade stick pro and mini pad for neogeo games, and use R1/R2 as 5th and 6th button for 6 buttons games like Street Fighter II (because it's also their modern layout), this is really convenient with most arcade sticks.

The following "device type" also exist, but they won't be compatible with every games :

* **Mouse (ball only)** : it will use mouse/trackball for analog movements, buttons will stay on retropad
* **Mouse (full)** : same as above, but the buttons will be on the mouse
* **Pointer** : it will use "pointer" device (can be a mouse/trackball) to determine coordinates on screen, buttons will stay on retropad
* **Lightgun** : it will use lightgun to determine coordinates on screen, buttons will be on the lightgun too.
* **Analog Arcade Gun** : it will use the analog stick for gun games but in a different way than "Classic" and "Modern", it is particularily useful if you have a "fixed arcade gun" (arcade gun mounted on an analog control).

The following device types are mostly WIP, they haven't been thoroughly tested and might contain major bugs (please report them) :

* **6-Panel** : assuming you are using a 6-button arcade panel and followed the "YXL as top row and BAR as bottom row" mapping recommendation, it will map the top row then the bottom row as a general rule (with some exceptions), note that some users might be more comfortable with Classic/Modern's BAYX's assignment for 4-buttons systems like neogeo.
* **Touchscreen** : a variant of the "Pointer" device type meant for mobile devices, touchscreen "tap events" are used for gameplay, "Start" and "Coin" are still assigned to your retropad overlay.

## Emulating consoles and computers

It also requires usage of specific romsets, meaning the rom must have the expected crc/size, and be packaged in an archive with a specific name (the instructions to build those romsets don't differ from arcade's).

You can use specific folder's name for detection, it's the easiest and recommended method, especially if you are using RetroArch playlists or if your device is not compatible with subsystems (android and consoles) :

* CBS ColecoVision : `coleco` | `colecovision`
* Fairchild ChannelF : `chf` | `channelf`
* MSX 1 : `msx` | `msx1`
* Nec PC-Engine : `pce` | `pcengine`
* Nec SuperGrafX : `sgx` | `supergrafx`
* Nec TurboGrafx-16 : `tg16`
* Nintendo Entertainment System : `nes`
* Nintendo Family Disk System : `fds`
* Super Nintendo Entertainment System : `snes`
* Sega GameGear : `gamegear`
* Sega Master System : `sms` | `mastersystem`
* Sega Megadrive : `megadriv` | `megadrive` | `genesis`
* Sega SG-1000 : `sg1000`
* SNK Neo-Geo Pocket : `ngp`
* SNK Neo-Geo CD : `neocd`
* ZX Spectrum : `spectrum` | `zxspectrum`

You can also emulate consoles by prefixing the name of the roms with `XXX_` and removing the `zip|7z` extension in the command line, or adding the `--subsystem XXX` argument, here is the list of available prefixes :

* CBS ColecoVision : `cv`
* Fairchild ChannelF : `chf`
* MSX 1 : `msx`
* Nec PC-Engine : `pce`
* Nec SuperGrafX : `sgx`
* Nec TurboGrafx-16 : `tg`
* Nintendo Entertainment System : `nes`
* Nintendo Family Disk System : `fds`
* Super Nintendo Entertainment System : `snes`
* Sega GameGear : `gg`
* Sega Master System : `sms`
* Sega Megadrive : `md`
* Sega SG-1000 : `sg1k`
* SNK Neo-Geo Pocket : `ngp`
* SNK Neo-Geo CD : `neocd`
* ZX Spectrum : `spec`

## BIOS

When loading a romset requiring a bios romset, it will be searched through 3 folders in that order :

* the folder of the current romset
* the `SYSTEM_DIRECTORY/fbneo/` folder
* the `SYSTEM_DIRECTORY/` folder

The following bios romsets are required for some of the emulated arcade systems :

| Romset name | Note                                       |

## Hiscores

Copy [hiscore.dat](https://github.com/libretro/FBNeo/raw/master/metadata/hiscore.dat) to `SYSTEM_DIRECTORY/fbneo/` and have the hiscore core option enabled.

It doesn't guarantee hiscores will work for a specific game though, sometimes a driver could just be missing the necessary support code for this feature, or `hiscore.dat` might have a missing or broken entry for that romset. You can request support in the issue tracker. 

Runahead now works with hiscores, it'll require fairly recent version of the core AND RetroArch though (support was added after 1.10.3).

## Input lag reduction

This core widely supports the RetroArch input latency reduction features, with **runahead single instance** and **preemptive frames** being the recommended methods. 

Proper support for **runahead second instance** is not guaranteed because it doesn't exist in standalone FBNeo unlike the other methods.

Note : There seems to be possible conflicts when rewind is active simultaneously, see https://github.com/libretro/RetroArch/issues/16374.

## RetroAchievements

This core provides support for RetroAchievements, and some were added for popular games.

## Dipswitches

They are either directly available from `Quick Menu > Core Options`, or from the service menu after setting its shortcut in the `Diagnostic Input` core option.

## Cheats

This core supports the RetroArch cheat feature with the `.cht` files. However it is recommended to use FBNeo's native cheat support instead :

* Download the pack of cheats from [here](https://github.com/finalburnneo/FBNeo-cheats/archive/master.zip)
* Uncompress **all of them** into the `SYSTEM_DIRECTORY/fbneo/cheats/` folder (which is **NOT** the same folder as the RetroArch feature with the `.cht` files)
* Cheats will become available through core options (`Quick Menu > Core Options`, **NOT** `Quick Menu > Cheats`) afterward.

## Multi-language

This core supports multi-language feature.

* Multi-language is based on the front-end User UI language switching
* Simplified Chinese and Traditional Chinese have been added.

## Frequently asked questions

### Where can i find the XXX roms ?

As far as we are concerned, you are supposed to dump your own games, so we can't help you with acquiring romsets.

### Why am i getting a white screen ?

If present, the line `Verify the following romsets : <romset> <parent> <bios>` gives you the list of split romsets required by the game you are trying to run. This is mainly for reference since you might not be striving to use romsets in split format. The next few lines give you the list of files it couldn't find within those romsets.

Otherwise, a `Romset is unknown` message means the romset couldn't be found by its filename in our database.

Both problems result from not reading the [arcade documentation](https://docs.libretro.com/guides/arcade-getting-started/#step-3-use-the-correct-version-romsets-for-that-emulator).
Exceptionally there might be false positives due to your files being unreadable for some reason (file corruption during transfer, file permission, damaged disk drive, [retroarch regression](https://github.com/libretro/RetroArch/issues/18582), ...). This is usually a rabbit hole and something you should only concern yourself after using clrmamepro to verify your romsets.

Rarely you could get a "Failed initializing driver" message, this is something you should report [here](https://github.com/finalburnneo/FBNeo/issues)

### How can i run that romhack i found ?

A lot of romhacks are supported natively, so your romhack might already be supported under a specific romset name.

For the unsupported romhacks, there are 3 methods, but those romhacks are not allowed and must be disabled by toggling off the `Allow patched romsets` core option if you intend to use RetroAchievements : 

#### Using the "patched" folder

* Put the patched version of the romset into `SYSTEM_DIRECTORY/fbneo/patched`, this folder has special privileges allowing it to ignore crcs. Sizes and names still need to match the original romset though.
* Optional : you could strip the patched version from any file that don't differ from the original romset.

#### Using IPS Patches

* Put all IPS patch files (including: driver name directory/**.dat|**.ips) into the `SYSTEM_DIRECTORY/fbneo/ips/` folder.
* IPS Patch will become available through core options (`Quick Menu > Core Options`) afterward. To apply them, you need to launch the game, enable them in core options, then use RetroArch's "restart" action.
* Note : To avoid competing with loaded games for startup privileges, IPS Patches is initially disabled by default.

#### Using RomData

* Put all RomData files (including: driver name directory/**.dat) into the `SYSTEM_DIRECTORY/fbneo/romdata/` folder
* RomData will become available through core options (`Quick Menu > Core Options`) afterward. To apply them, you need to launch the game, enable them in core options, then use RetroArch's "restart" action.

Please note that all 3 methods still require that you launch the original non-patched romset, it will be patched/replaced at runtime.

### How can i run that unibios i bought from http://unibios.free.fr/ ?

Use the "patched folder" method from above.

### I think i found a glitch, how do i report it ?

Write a report [here](https://github.com/finalburnneo/FBNeo/issues) with details on the issue and your platform.
If the issue is not self-explanatory, it is important to provide a video of the PCB (meaning real hardware), any other material (remakes, other emulators, fpga, game rips, ...) will be ignored.
If the issue doesn't happen right from the beginning, please try to provide a savestate from right before the issue.

### Why does game XXX run slowly ?

Your hardware is probably too slow to run the game with your current settings. Try the following :

* Check if there is a speedhack dipswitch in the core options, set it to "yes".
* Try disabling rewind, runahead, pre-emptive frames, shaders, or any other retroarch setting known for increasing requirements.
* Try enabling "Threaded Video" in retroarch settings.
* Try changing "Max swapchain images" in retroarch settings (higher values gave a small performance benefit on my setup).
* Try setting a value for frameskip in core options (note : "Fixed" frameskip is recommended, the other methods don't seem to be nearly as reliable).
* Try lowering CPU clock in core options (note : some games don't support this feature).
* Try lowering audio settings in the core options.
* With m68k games (most boards from the late 80s and early 90s) on arm platforms, you can try enabling cyclone in core options, however this is really a last resort since some games won't work properly with this, furthermore it's causing savestates incompatibilities.
* If it is not enough, upgrade/overclock your hardware, or use another core.

We won't accept requests for "making the core faster", as far as we are concerned this core has a good balance between accuracy & speed, and for the most part will already run really well on low-end devices (rpi3, ...).

### Why does game XXX have choppy sound ?

Most likely for the same reason as above.

### Why does game XXX run faster in MAME2003/MAME2010 ?

Overall, FBNeo is slower than old MAME version, because it's more accurate, meaning graphics, sound and gameplay are more likely to be faithful to the real machine.
This libretro port also supports various features which are usually buggy or totally missing in MAME cores (runahead, netplay, rewind, retroachievements, ...), those features might require additional resources.

### How do i launch a neogeo CD game ?

There are several things to know :

* You need to follow the instructions about [emulating consoles](#emulating-consoles-and-computers)
* You need a copy of the `neocdz.zip` and `neogeo.zip` bioses
* The supported format is single file MODE1/2352 cue/bin (the format where there is one .cue file with one single .bin file). Use "CDmage" to convert your dump if needed. **It must not be compressed**

You can convert your unsupported dumps by following this tutorial :

* Get [CDMage 1.02.1 (beta)](https://www.videohelp.com/software/CDMage) (freeware & no ads). **Don't get CDMage 1.01.5, it doesn't have the "Save As" function**
* File > Open > select your dump (NB : always choose the .cue file if there is one)
* File > Save As > write the name of your new file
* Make sure you select MODE1/2352 in the second drop-down
* Press OK, wait for the process to finish (a few seconds on my computer), and it’s done !

### Why can't i launch Killer instinct ? I heard it's supported.

That driver was disabled for now, it didn't meet our quality criteria.

### Where is the hires dipswitch on vector games ? It seems gone.

It was streamlined into a global `Resolution` core option affecting all vector games at once, with new resolutions available.

For best visual results, it's recommended to match your screen's height, some examples using a 1080p screen :
* for horizontal games, you'll want to use 1440x1080
* for vertical games (tempest, tacscan), if you are running them on a vertical screen with the settings to rotate them, you'll also want to use 1440x1080
* for those same vertical games, if you are running them at default settings on a horizontal screen, you'll want to use 1080x810

### Why are vertical games not working properly ?

2 settings are required when running vertical games in FBNeo :

* `Settings > Core > Allow rotation` must be enabled  (`video_allow_rotate = "true"` in `retroarch.cfg`)
* `Settings > Video > Scaling > Aspect Ratio` should be set to `Core Provided` (`aspect_ratio_index = "22"` in `retroarch.cfg`)

If you are wondering why this isn't required for the MAME core, you can find more information about it [here](https://github.com/libretro/mame/issues/261)

Additionally :

* If you are playing on a vertical screen, you'll want to use the `Vertical Mode` core option to rotate the display for your needs, it should also be possible to rotate display from `Settings > Video > Output > Video Rotation` but that method might handle the aspect ratio incorrectly.
* If you are using a bezel pack, make sure it's compatible with FBNeo (apparently, some were written specifically to work with MAME's internal rotation) and to follow its official instructions. In some case it seems enabling `Settings > On-Screen Display > On-Screen Overlay > Auto-Scale Overlay` (`input_overlay_auto_scale = "true"` in `retroarch.cfg`) can help.

### Why is the music high-pitched, too fast and/or different from what i think it should be ?

The first question you should be asking yourself is "what am i comparing this to ?", emulation is meant to be faithful to real hardware (here the original arcade board), not to some console port, remaster, other emulator, or ost.

If you are comparing this to FBNeo standalone, you must be warned that the libretro port is using different default audio settings. 
By default standalone has 44100 samplerate and both interpolations off, and that's what you should set in core options if you want the same audio output.

Last but not least, you might also want to make sure you are running the game at the correct speed, most crt games don't run at 60Hz and if you want the proper refresh rate to be emulated you'll need to make sure `Force 60Hz` isn't enabled in core options and `Settings > Video > Synchronization > Sync to Exact Content Framerate` is enabled (`vrr_runloop_enable = "true"` in `retroarch.cfg`). 
Please note that it'll likely cause frame duping if your hardware is not compatible with VRR (Variable Refresh Rate), in which case you'll have to make a choice between animation smoothness and correct refresh rate.

### Why do i get a black screen and/or can't i change bios in neogeo games ?

The `neogeo` romset is a collection of neogeo bioses, and most of them are considered as optional so they won't cause a "white screen" when missing. Only `MVS Asia/Europe ver. 6 (1 slot)` is mandatory.

However, having an incomplete romset can still cause various issues :

* If you are using the "Use bios set in BIOS dipswitch" as "Neo-Geo mode" and the bios set in dipswitches is missing, you'll have a black screen where you can hear some sound playing.
* If you are using any of the other choices available in "Neo-Geo mode" and a corresponding bios can't be found, the core will fallback to one of the available bioses.

Obviously, none of this is supposed to ever happen if you followed the instructions about romsets as you are supposed to.

### Why do i get some weird transparent effects in game XXX ?

You probably installed some `.bld` files in the `SYSTEM_DIRECTORY/fbneo/blend` folder. Those files are meant to create such effects but some of them are very broken. I'd recommend removing them.

### Why is my favorite combo button not available ?

Libretro doesn't allow cores to declare more buttons and map them later, meaning the number of different "actions" available is limited by the number of buttons available on the retropad model.

Removing that limitation was asked in https://github.com/libretro/RetroArch/issues/6718, then again in https://github.com/libretro/RetroArch/issues/11273, it's not possible to add more macros as long as this limitation exists. If you want more macros, go support those issues, preferably the later.

The currently available neogeo combos were decided in https://github.com/libretro/FBNeo/issues/51, they won't be replaced, but they might totally disappear if users keep complaining about them.

Note that there was also a request to add a retroarch macro mapper in https://github.com/libretro/RetroArch/issues/8209.

There is also a PR currently opened to implement this : https://github.com/libretro/RetroArch/pull/16035.

### Why can't i enable hardcore mode in RetroAchievements ?

This feature doesn't accept achievements made with any kind of cheat, meaning unibios, cheats, and patched romsets must be disabled in core options.

### Why do i need to re-enable cheats every time i boot a game ?

It is common for arcade machines to execute self-tests at boot, and in many cases they won't boot if unexpected values have been injected into their memory, which is exactly what cheats do. Disabling cheats at boot is a safety mecanism to prevent those boot issues.

### Why do the self-tests at boot fail ?

Sometimes the NVRAM/EEPROM saved on your disk gets corrupted for some reason, Konami games are especially known for getting this issue *somewhat frequently*.
NVRAM/EEPROM are saved in the `SAVEFILES_DIRECTORY/fbneo` folder, and you can get around this issue by finding the files corresponding to your game and deleting them.

### Should i use retroarch's analog-to-digital feature ?

You should **NEVER** use that feature with this core, it already converts analog to digital and digital to analog internally. Exceptionally it might not do that conversion because each of those controls are already doing their own thing.

### Where is SYSTEM_DIRECTORY ?

Open your `retroarch.cfg` file and look for `system_directory`, or check `Settings > Directory > System/BIOS`.
