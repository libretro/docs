## BIOS

Gearsystem does not require BIOS (bootrom) files to work but they can be used optionally.

When the BIOS is enabled it will execute as in original hardware, causing invalid roms to lock or preventing them to boot, depending on the BIOS file and rom region and system. If you experience issues disable the BIOS.

Required or optional firmware files go in the frontend's system directory.

!!! attention
	 If you’d like to use any BIOS, you can place the following files in RetroArch's system directory. Then, you need to enable [Master System BIOS](#core-options) and/or [Game Gear BIOS](#core-options) core options for these BIOS files to be used.

| Filename     | Description                        | md5sum                           |
|:------------:|:----------------------------------:|:--------------------------------:|
| bios.sms     | Master System BIOS - Optional      | 840481177270d5642a14ca71ee72844c |
| bios.gg      | Game Gear BIOS - Optional          | 672e104c3be3a238301aceffc3b23fd6 |

## Core options

The Gearsystem core has the following options that can be tweaked from the core options menu. The default setting is bolded.

Settings with (Restart) means that core has to be closed for the new setting to be applied on next launch.

- **System (restart)** [gearsystem_system] (**Auto**|Master System / Mark III|Game Gear|SG-1000 / Multivision)
