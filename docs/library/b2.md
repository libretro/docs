## Directories

No additional directories used, only content disk image is needed.

## Geometry and timing

- The b2 core's core provided FPS is 50
- The b2 core's core provided sample rate is 250 kHz (to be optimized)
- The b2 core's base width is 768
- The b2 core's base height is 288
- The b2 core's max width is 768
- The b2 core's max height is 576 (interlace mode)
- The b2 core's core provided aspect ratio is 4:3

## Usage

Load any supported content file. Content type will be autodetected, and if possible, started:

- If disk image name contains an executable file name in brackets (such as `[CHUCKIE]`), a `CHAIN` command will be issued shortly after initial booting
- If disk image name does not contain such indication, Shift key press will be simulated during boot to trigger autoboot function

In case of multi-disk games, use the Disk Control menu to add the subsequent images and switch between them.

## Core options

The b2 core has the following option(s) that can be tweaked from the core options menu.

- Emulated machine
  - `B/Acorn 1770`
  - `B/Watford 1770 (DDB2)`
  - `B/Watford 1770 (DDB3)`
  - `B/Opus 1770`
  - `B/Opus CHALLENGER 256K`
  - `B/Opus CHALLENGER 512K`
  - `B+`
  - `B+128`
- Autoboot (on|off)
- Keyboard assignments for each RetroPad button

## Joypad mapping

The analogue joysticks are mapped to the left analog stick and face button A for RetroArch player 1 and 2 slots.

Joypad is fully assignable to keyboard keys in core options.

## Keyboard

Keyboard layout of the BBC Micro:
![](../image/core/b2/bbc-micro-keyboard.png)

Most mappings are straightforward positionally from an ISO UK keyboard:

- Dark green: natural mapping, both position and function matches nicely
- Light green: either position or function is slightly different
- Yellow: function is different
- Red: extra mapping
- Dark grey: keys intentionally reserved for RetroArch / OS functions
