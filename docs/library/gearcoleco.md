## Core options

The Gearcoleco core has the following options that can be tweaked from the core options menu. The default setting is bolded.

Settings with (Restart) means that core has to be closed for the new setting to be applied on next launch.

- **Refresh Rate (restart)** [gearcoleco_timing] (**Auto**|NTSC (60 Hz)|PAL (50 Hz))

    Select which refresh rate will be used in emulation.

    - *Auto* selects the best refresh rate based in the rom.
    - *NTSC (60 Hz)* forces 60 Hz.
    - *PAL (50 Hz)* forces 50 Hz.

- **Aspect Ratio** [gearcoleco_aspect_ratio] (**Auto**|4:3|16:9)

    Select which aspect ratio will be presented by the core.

    - *1:1 PAR* selects an aspect ratio that produces square pixels.
    - *4:3 DAR* forces 4:3 aspect ratio.
    - *16:9 DAR* forces 16:9 aspect ratio.
    - *16:10 DAR* forces 16:10 aspect ratio.

- **Overscan** [gearcoleco_overscan] (**Disabled**|Top+Bottom|Full)

    Select which overscan (borders) will be used in emulation.

    - *Disabled* disables overscan.
    - *Top+Bottom* enables overscan for top and bottom.
    - *Full (284 width)* enables overscan for top, bottom, left and right (284 width).
    - *Full (320 width)* enables overscan for top, bottom, left and right (320 width).

- **Allow Up+Down / Left+Right** [gearcoleco_up_down_allowed] (**Disabled**|Enabled)

    Enabling this will allow pressing / quickly alternating / holding both left and right (or up and down in some games) directions at the same time.

    This may cause movement based glitches to occur in certain games.

    It's best to keep this core option disabled.

- **No Sprite Limit** [gearcoleco_no_sprite_limit] (**Disabled**|Enabled)

    Enabling this will remove the sprite limit in a single line.

    This may cause glitches to occur in certain games.

    It's best to keep this core option disabled.

- **Spinner Support** [gearcoleco_spinners] (**Disabled**|Super Action Controller|Wheel Controller|Roller Controller)

    Select which controller will be used in emulation. Spinners are controlled by mouse movement. Mouse buttons are mapped to Left (Yellow) and Right (Red) buttons.

    - *Disabled* disables spinner support.
    - *Super Action Controller* enables spinner support for Super Action Controller.
    - *Wheel Controller* enables spinner support for Wheel Controller.
    - *Roller Controller* enables spinner support for Roller Controller.

- **Spinner Sensitivity** [gearcoleco_spinner_sensitivity] (**1**|1-10)

    Select the spinner sensitivity.

    - *1* is the lowest sensitivity.
    - *10* is the highest sensitivity.
