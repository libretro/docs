## BIOS

Gearboy does not require bootrom (BIOS) files to work but they can be used optionally.

When the bootrom is enabled it will execute as in original hardware, causing invalid roms to lock or forcing hardware like GB Pocket or GBA, depending on the bootrom file.

Required or optional firmware files go in the frontend's system directory.

!!! attention
	 If you’d like to use any bootrom, you can place the following files in RetroArch's system directory. Then, you need to enable [DMG Bootrom](#core-options) and/or [Game Boy Color Bootrom](#core-options) core options for these bootrom files to be used.

| Filename     | Description                        | md5sum                           |
|:------------:|:----------------------------------:|:--------------------------------:|
| dmg_boot.bin | Game Boy boot ROM - Optional       | 32fbbd84168d3482956eb3c5051637f5 |

## Core options

The Gearboy core has the following options that can be tweaked from the core options menu. The default setting is bolded.

Settings with (Restart) means that core has to be closed for the new setting to be applied on next launch.

- **Game Boy Model (restart)** [gearboy_model] (**Auto**|Game Boy DMG|Game Boy Advance)

	Select which hardware/model is emulated.

    - *Auto* selects the best hardware based in the rom.
    - *Game Boy DMG* forces original Game Boy hardware.
    - *Game Boy Advance* enables Game Boy Advance hardware.

- **Mapper (restart)** [gearboy_mapper] (**Auto**|ROM Only|MBC 1|MBC 2|MBC 3|MBC 5|MBC 1 Multicart)

	Select which Memory Bank Controller (MBC or mapper) is emulated.

    - *Auto* selects the best MBC based in the rom.
    - *ROM Only* forces no MBC.
    - *MBC 1* forces MBC 1.
    - *MBC 2* forces MBC 2.
    - *MBC 3* forces MBC 3 + RTC.
    - *MBC 5* forces MBC 5.
    - *MBC 1 Multicart* forces MBC 1 Multicart.

- **DMG Palette** [gearboy_palette] (**Original**|Sharp|B/W|Autumn|Soft|Slime)

	Select a color palette for Game Boy DMG games.

- **DMG Bootrom** [gearboy_bootrom_dmg] (**Disabled**|Enabled)

	This option will enable/disable bootrom for Game Boy DMG model. For this to work, the `dmg_boot.bin` file must exist in the Retro Arch's system directory.

- **Game Boy Color Bootrom** [gearboy_bootrom_gbc] (**Disabled**|Enabled)

	This option will enable/disable bootrom for Game Boy Color model. For this to work, the `cgb_boot.bin` file must exist in the Retro Arch's system directory.

- **Allow Up+Down / Left+Right** [gearboy_up_down_allowed] (**Disabled**|Enabled)

	Enabling this will allow pressing / quickly alternating / holding both left and right (or up and down in some games) directions at the same time.

	This may cause movement based glitches to occur in certain games.

	It's best to keep this core option disabled.
