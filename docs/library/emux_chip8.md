## Background

Emux is a cross-platform emulator project with a goal of emulating multiple kinds of machines related to gaming, such as consoles or arcades. Its philosophy is very much inspired by the Linux kernel (hence the name), which brilliantly manages to support multiple machines while keeping drivers entirely platform-independent. Emux is designed in the same way, keeping a code base of CPUs and controllers separate from machines.

### How to get and install the Emux CHIP-8 core:

1. Start up RetroArch. Inside the main menu, go to 'Online Updater'.

2. Just to make sure we have the latest info files, select 'Update Core Info FIles'. Wait until this is done. Then, select 'Core Downloader'.

3. Browse through the list and select 'CHIP-8 (Emux)'.

After this has finished downloading, the core should now be ready for use!
