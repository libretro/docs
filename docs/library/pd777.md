# Epoch - Cassette Vision (PD777)

## Background

μPD777 is an emulator for the Epoch Cassette Vision, from Japan in 1981.
It was one of the first Japanese consoles with interchangeable cartridges, but
included a full CPU in each cartridge --- the console base was mostly buttons
and wires.

The Cassette Vision Jr (1983) used the same software, but dropped the paddle controls.

PD777 is a Libretro port, to run in RetroArch.


The PD777 core has been authored by:

- W88DodPECuThLOl (Standalone PD777)
- Ken Mitton

The PD777 core is licensed under:

- [MIT](https://github.com/mittonk/PD777/blob/main/LICENSE)

A summary of the licenses behind RetroArch and its cores can be found [here](../development/licenses.md).

## Requirements

Minimal.

## How to start the PD777 core:

ROM file handling is slightly awkward because of the two-file ROM format.

1. Zip-files (bundling one `.bin777` and one `.ptn777`) are supported.
1. Supply a `.bin777` file to load; the core looks for a similarly-named `.ptn777` file in the same directory.

There is not yet a suitable single-file format for the Cassette Vision.
If ROM loading fails, the core will run a built-in balloon demo, as in standalone emulator.

## BIOS

None.

## Extensions

Content that can be loaded by the PD777 core have the following file extensions:

- .zip
- .bin777

RetroArch database(s) that are associated with the PD777 core:

- None yet

## Usage

Standard.

## Core options

Input > Announce Course Switch: Show the new setting of the Course Select Switch when changing it with up/down buttons.

## User 1 device types

The PD777 core supports the following device type(s) in the controls menu, bolded device types are the default for the specified user(s):

- **RetroPad**
- RetroPad w/Analog
- Mouse

## Joypad

The controls were built into the base unit, and some 2-player games assign buttons asymmetrically; for example, New Baseball gives most of the buttons to the fielding player, with just Lever Switch 1 for the batting player.
