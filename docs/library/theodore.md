### Directories

The Theodore core's internal core name is 'theodore'.

**Frontend's System directory**

| File         | Description |
|:------------:|:-----------:|
| theodore.cfg | Config file |

### Geometry and timing

- The Theodore core's base width is 672 pixels.
- The Theodore core's base height is 432 pixels.

## Usage

Once the content and core are loaded the start screen is displayed as
shown below.

![](../image/core/theodore/to8d_os.jpg)

Now it is time to start BASIC 512 that will run the program on the bootable device currently presented. To do that you only have to press the "B" button of your joypad that is conveniently mapped to the "B" key (except for TO9 where the "B" button is mapped to the "D" key to start BASIC 128).

!!! Notes
        - BASIC 512 works for a vast majority of games.
        - In case of failure try the 2nd BASIC by pressing "C" key.
        - When using a cartridge, the "B" button is mapped to the "A" key to start the program on the cartridge (entry not shown here).

## Core options

The Theodore core has the following option(s) that can be tweaked from the core options menu. The default setting is bolded.

- **Thomson flavor** [theodore_rom]  (**TO8**|TO8D|TO9|TO9+|MO5)

- **Floppy write protection** [theodore_floppy_write_protect]  (disabled|**enabled**)

- **Tape write protection** [theodore_tape_write_protect]  (disabled|**enabled**)

- **Dump printer data to file** [theodore_printer_emulation] (**disabled**|enabled)

## Joypad

| ![](../image/retropad/retro_y.png)     | Virtual keyboard: go down      |
| ![](../image/retropad/retro_start.png) | Virtual keyboard: keystroke    |

On controllers without Y/X keys, select can also be used to roll the virtual keyboard up. The order of the keys in the virtual keyboard is: digits (0->9) then letters (A->Z) then "Space" then "Enter".
