## Salamander

Salamander is a small RetroArch launcher for embedded platforms with static linking. On such platforms, each core binary contains the core and the complete RetroArch frontend. Switching cores is achieved by just re-launching into a different core binary. Salamander simply launches the most recently used core (or a default one, if none is stored in the config file).
